"<b>BACKGROUND: </b>Bone spicule pigments (BSP) are a hallmark of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this study, we examined the process of BSP formation in the rhodopsin knockout (rho (-/-)) mouse, a murine model for human RP.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>In rho (-/-) mice from 2 to 16 months of age, representing the range from early to late stages of degeneration, retinal sections and whole mounts were examined morphologically by light and electron microscopy. The results were compared to scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of BSP degeneration in human RP.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>After the loss of all photoreceptor cells in rho-/- mice, the outer retina successively degenerated, leading to approximation and finally a direct contact of inner retinal vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We could show that it was the event of proximity of retinal vessel and RPE that triggered migration of RPE cells along the contacting vessels towards the inner retina. Ultrastructurally, these mislocalized RPE cells partially sealed the vessels by tight junction linkage and deposited extracellular matrix perivascularly. Also, the vascular endothelium developed fenestrations similar to the RPE-choroid interface. In whole mounts, the pigmented cell clusters outlining retinal capillaries correlated well with BSPs in human RP. The structure of the inner retina remained well preserved, even in late stages.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The Rho (-/-) mouse is the first animal model that depicts all major pathological changes, even in the late stages of RP. Using the rho (-/-) mouse model we were able to analyze the complete dynamic process of BSP formation. Therefore we conclude that: (1) In rho (-/-) retinas, BSPs only form in areas devoid of photoreceptors; (2) Direct contact between inner retinal vessels and RPE appears to be a major trigger for migration of RPE cells; (3) The distribution of the RPE cells in BSPs reflects the vascular network at the time of formation. The similarity of the disease process between mouse and human and the possibility to study all consecutive steps of the course of the disease makes the rho (-/-) mouse valuable for further insights in the dynamics of BSP formation in human RP.<br/>", "score": 11, "id": "20012642", "title": "Bone spicule pigment formation in retinitis pigmentosa: insights from a mouse model."}, {"abstract": "Complexins regulate the speed and Ca(2+) sensitivity of SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion at conventional synapses. Two of the vertebrate complexins, Cplx3 and Cplx4, are specifically localized to retinal ribbon synapses. To test whether Cplx3 and Cplx4 contribute to the highly efficient transmitter release at ribbon synapses, we studied retina function and structure in Cplx3 and Cplx4 single- and double-knockout mice. Electroretinographic recordings from single and double mutants revealed a cooperative perturbing effect of Cplx3 and Cplx4 deletion on the b-wave amplitude, whereas most other detected effects in both plexiform synaptic layers were additive. Light and electron microscopic analyses uncovered a disorganized outer plexiform layer in the retinae of mice lacking Cplx3 and Cplx4, with a significant proportion of photoreceptor terminals containing spherical free-floating ribbons. These structural and functional aberrations were accompanied by behavioural deficits indicative of a vision deficit. Our results show that Cplx3 and Cplx4 are essential regulators of transmitter release at retinal ribbon synapses. Their loss leads to aberrant adjustment and fine-tuning of transmitter release at the photoreceptor ribbon synapse, alterations in transmission at bipolar cell terminals, changes in the temporal structure of synaptic processing in the inner plexiform layer of the retina and perturbed vision.", "score": 5, "id": "19386896", "title": "Aberrant function and structure of retinal ribbon synapses in the absence of complexin 3 and complexin 4."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>Mutations in the photoreceptor-specific tubby-like protein 1 (TULP1) underlie a form of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.

Retinal function was characterized with the use of electroretinography.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>In wt mice, Tulp1 is localized to the photoreceptor synapse. In the tulp1(-/-) synapse, the spatial relationship between the ribbon-associated proteins Bassoon and Piccolo are disrupted, and few intact ribbons are present. Furthermore, bipolar cell dendrites are stunted. Comparable abnormalities are not seen in rd10 mice. The leading edge of the a-wave had normal kinetics in tulp1(-/-) mice but reduced gain in rd10 mice. The b-wave intensity-response functions of tulp1(-/-) mice are shifted to higher intensities than in wt mice, but those of rd10 mice are not.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Photoreceptor synapses and bipolar cell dendrites in tulp1(-/-) mice display abnormal structure and function. A malformation of the photoreceptor synaptic ribbon is likely the cause of the dystrophy in bipolar cell dendrites.

In the retinae of mice, mutant for the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bassoon, signal transfer at photoreceptor ribbon synapses is disturbed due to impaired ribbon attachment to the active zone. In a long-term study we observed, with light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry and electroretinographic recordings, two overlapping events in the Bassoon mutant retina, i.e. loss of photoreceptor synapses in the outer plexiform layer, and structural remodeling and formation of ectopic photoreceptor synapses in the outer nuclear layer, a region usually devoid of synapses. Formation of ectopic synaptic sites starts around the time when photoreceptor synaptogenesis is completed in wild-type mice and progresses throughout life. The result is a dense plexus of ectopic photoreceptor synapses with significantly altered but considerable synaptic transmission. Ectopic synapse formation is led by the sprouting of horizontal cells followed by the extension of rod bipolar cell neurites that fasciculate with and grow along the horizontal cell processes.

Immunostaining with bassoon and synaptophysin (as presynaptic markers) and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR6, a postsynaptic marker for ON-bipolar dendrites) was already impaired at postnatal day (P) 21 and progressively lost with infrequent pairing of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements at P60. By P90 to P120, staining became increasingly patchy and was eventually restricted to sparsely and irregularly distributed foci in which the normal pairing of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers was lost. ERG results showed that mixed scotopic a-waves and b-waves were already reduced by P21 but not oscillatory potentials. While cone-driven responses (photopic b-wave) reached normal levels at P30, they were impaired by P60 but could still be recorded at P120, although with reduced amplitude; rod responses never reached normal amplitudes. Thus, only cone-driven activity attained normal levels, but declined rapidly thereafter.

The results were compared to scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of BSP degeneration in human RP.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>After the loss of all photoreceptor cells in rho-/- mice, the outer retina successively degenerated, leading to approximation and finally a direct contact of inner retinal vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We could show that it was the event of proximity of retinal vessel and RPE that triggered migration of RPE cells along the contacting vessels towards the inner retina. Ultrastructurally, these mislocalized RPE cells partially sealed the vessels by tight junction linkage and deposited extracellular matrix perivascularly.

ERG results showed that mixed scotopic a-waves and b-waves were already reduced by P21 but not oscillatory potentials. While cone-driven responses (photopic b-wave) reached normal levels at P30, they were impaired by P60 but could still be recorded at P120, although with reduced amplitude; rod responses never reached normal amplitudes. Thus, only cone-driven activity attained normal levels, but declined rapidly thereafter.

These data propose that the presynaptic periactive zone surrounding the synaptic ribbon complex is a hotspot of endocytosis in photoreceptor ribbon synapses.", "score": 1, "id": "23785143", "title": "A local, periactive zone endocytic machinery at photoreceptor synapses in close vicinity to synaptic ribbons."}, {"abstract": "Several studies have shown the importance of calcium channels in the development and/or maturation of synapses. The Ca(V)1.4(\u03b1(1F)) knockout mouse is a unique model to study the role of calcium channels in photoreceptor synapse formation. It features abnormal ribbon synapses and aberrant cone morphology. We investigated the expression and targeting of several key elements of ribbon synapses and analyzed the cone morphology in the Ca(V)1.4(\u03b1(1F)) knockout retina. Our data demonstrate that most abnormalities occur after eye opening. Indeed, scaffolding proteins such as Bassoon and RIM2 are properly targeted at first, but their expression and localization are not maintained in adulthood. This indicates that either calcium or the Ca(V)1.4 channel, or both are necessary for the maintenance of their normal expression and distribution in photoreceptors. Other proteins, such as Veli3 and PSD-95, also display abnormal expression in rods prior to eye opening. Conversely, vesicle related proteins appear normal. Our data demonstrate that the Ca(V)1.4 channel is important for maintaining scaffolding proteins in the ribbon synapse but less vital for proteins related to vesicular release. This study also confirms that in adult retinae, cones show developmental features such as sprouting and synaptogenesis.

The performance of the ribbon synapse is accomplished by a specialization of the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) referred to as the synaptic ribbon (SR). Progress in our understanding of the structure-function relationship at the ribbon synapse has come from observations that, in photoreceptors lacking a full-size scaffolding protein Bassoon (Bsn(\u0394Ex4/5)), dissociation of SRs coincides with perturbed signal transfer. The aim of the present study has been to elaborate the role of Bassoon as a structural organizer of the ribbon synapse and to differentiate it with regard to the ambient lighting conditions. The ultrastructure of retinal ribbon synapses has been compared between wild-type (Wt) and Bsn(\u0394Ex4/5) mice adapted to light (low activity) and darkness (high activity). The results obtained suggest that Bassoon and environmental illumination synergistically and complementarily act as organizers of the ribbon synapse. Thus, light-dependent and Bassoon-independent regulation involves initial SR tethering to the membrane and a basic shape transition of ribbon material from spherical to rod-like, since darkness induces these features in Bsn(\u0394Ex4/5) rod spherules. However, the tight anchorage of the SR via an arciform density and the proper assembly of SRs to the full-sized horseshoe-shaped complex depend on Bassoon, as these steps fail in Bsn(\u0394Ex4/5) rod spherules.", "score": 1, "id": "23295987", "title": "Evidence for synergistic and complementary roles of Bassoon and darkness in organizing the ribbon synapse."}, {"abstract": "Photoreceptor cells encode light signals over a wide range of intensities with graded changes in their membrane potential. At their highly specialized ribbon synapses they transmit the signals to the postsynaptic neurons by the tonic release of glutamate, which is continuously adjusted to changes in light intensity. Such a level of performance requires adaptive mechanisms, and it is suggested that illumination-dependent changes in ribbon shape and size are one of these adaptive processes. In this study we compared structural properties of synaptic ribbons under various illumination conditions between three mouse strains: the pigmented C57BL/6 and the two albino strains Balb/c and B6(Cg)-Tyr(c-2J) /J (coisogenic to C57BL/6). In addition, electroretinograms (ERGs) recorded in the same groups were compared. In the C57BL/6 mouse a change in illumination did not result in structural alterations of the synaptic ribbon. Similarly, in the B6(Cg)-Tyr(c-2J) /J mouse only minor structural changes were detected. In contrast, the state of adaptation had a large influence on the ribbon structure of the Balb/c mouse. The ERG recordings showed only small functional differences between C57BL/6 and B6(Cg)-Tyr(c-2J) /J mice, but the retinal function of Balb/c mice was strongly compromised.

However, to date their precise regional and subcellular distribution has remained elusive. Here, we examine the spatiotemporal expression patterns of Liprins-\u03b1 in the rodent by using in situ hybridization, immunoblotting, and immunochemistry of primary cells as well as brain and retina sections. We show that Liprin-\u03b11-4 mRNA and protein are widely expressed throughout the developing and adult central nervous system, with Liprin-\u03b12 and -\u03b13 being the major Liprin-\u03b1 isoforms in the brain. Our data show that the four Liprin-\u03b1 proteins differ in their regional distribution, in particular in the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb. Liprin-\u03b11 exhibits a unique spatiotemporal expression pattern as its levels decrease during synaptogenesis, and it is the only Liprin-\u03b1 with substantial non-neuronal expression. Immunocytochemistry of cultured primary neurons with pre- and postsynaptic marker proteins shows all four Liprins-\u03b1 to be present at synapses and nonsynaptic sites to varying degrees.

A core component of the precursor spheres and a key player in attaching the ribbon to the active zone is the presynaptic cytomatrix protein Bassoon. In this study, we examined in a comprehensive light and electron microscopic analysis whether Bassoon plays a role in the formation of the precursor spheres using Bassoon mutant mice lacking functional Bassoon. We report that developing Bassoon mutant photoreceptors contain fewer and smaller precursor spheres and that transport of precursor spheres to nascent synapses is delayed compared to wild-type controls. Moreover, western blot analyses of homogenates from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P14 Bassoon mutant retinae exhibit lower RIBEYE and Piccolo protein levels compared to the wild type, indicating elevated protein degradation in the absence of Bassoon.

Following from a previous study showing that the SCN undergoes day/night rearrangements of its neuronal-glial network that may be crucial for intercellular phasing, we investigated the contribution of glutamatergic synapses, known to play major roles in SCN functioning, to such rhythmic plastic events. Neither expression levels of the vesicular glutamate transporters nor numbers of glutamatergic terminals showed nycthemeral variations in the SCN. However, using quantitative imaging after combined immunolabelling, the density of synapses on neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide, known as targets of the retinal input, increased during the day and both glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic synapses contributed to the increase (+36%). This was not the case for synapses made on vasopressin-containing neurons, the other major source of SCN efferents in the non-retinorecipient region. Together with electron microscope observations showing no differences in the morphometric features of glutamatergic terminals during the day and night, these data show that the light synchronization process in the SCN involves a selective remodelling of synapses at sites of photic integration.

Among these, 34 genes were characterized or partially characterized, of which 11 (32%) had a role in vascular smooth muscle or endothelial cells.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>Expression of genes on chromosome 4q35 was normally regulated in the early stages of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Our results support a possible link between muscular dystrophy and retinal vasculopathy in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.<br/>", "score": 3, "id": "17151338", "title": "Expression profile of

Retinal lysates from Dbh(-/-) and their heterozygote littermates (Dbh(+/-)) were used to examine the role of norepinephrine in the regulation of IGF-1 receptor signaling and apoptosis in the retina. Western blot analysis was done for protein levels of total and phosphorylated IGF-1 receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), and Akt. A caspase 3 ELISA and dopamine ELISA were done on retinal lysates. To verify which regions of the retina were undergoing apoptosis, TUNEL labeling was performed. No changes in dopamine were noted between the KO and heterozygote mice. IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation was significantly decreased in Dbh(-/-) mice as compared to their heterozygote littermates (P<0.05 vs. heterozygous mice). IRS-1 protein phosphorylation was significantly decreased in KO mice (P<0.05 vs. heterozygous mice), while no significant changes were noted in IRS-2 protein phosphorylation. Akt protein phosphorylation was also reduced in the KO mice, likely leading to increased cleaved caspase 3 levels. The increase in apoptosis in the Dbh(-/-) mice occurred predominantly in the inner retina. Our results suggest that IGF-1 receptor signaling is reduced in the retina of mice with dysfunctional adrenergic receptor signaling. The data also indicate that IGF-1 receptor signaling occurs primarily through IRS-1, rather than IRS-2. The reduction in Akt phosphorylation, likely through reduced IGF-1 receptor signaling, could explain the increase in cleaved caspase 3, leading to apoptosis.

Loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in diabetic IRS2(-/-) mice restores insulin sensitivity and normalizes glucose homeostasis. Since insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-IR promotes survival of photoreceptors and is a substrate of PTP1B, we investigated IGF-IR-mediated survival signaling and visual function in PTP1B(-/-) and double mutant IRS2(-/-)/PTP1B(-/-) mice.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>IGF-IR-mediated Akt signaling was evaluated in IGF-I-stimulated retinal explants. Histologic and electroretinogram analysis was performed in wild-type (WT), IRS2(-/-), PTP1B(-/-), and the double mutant IRS2(-/-)/PTP1B(-/-) mice.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>IGF-I stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor and Akt activation in retinal explants of WT mice. In PTP1B(-/-) retinal explants, these responses were enhanced. Conversely, in retinas from IRS2(-/-) mice, expression of PTP1B was increased, coincident with decreased IGF-I-mediated Akt serine 473 phosphorylation. PTP1B deletion in IRS2(-/-) mice also enhanced IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation but, unexpectedly, did not rescue Akt activation in response to IGF-I. One potential explanation is that PTEN was increased in retinas of IRS2(-/-) and IRS2(-/-)/PTP1B(-/-) mice. Histologic evaluation revealed alterations in various structures of the retina in IRS2(-/-) and IRS2(-/-)/PTP1B(-/-) mice, specifically in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and retinal outer segments (ROS). Electroretinogram (ERG) analysis confirmed that PTP1B deficiency did not restore visual function in IRS2(-/-) mice.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Although loss of PTP1B enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR in retinal explants of IRS2(-/-) mice, Akt activation remains defective owing to elevated PTEN levels and, thus, structural and functional visual defects persist in this model.<br/>", "score": 7, "id": "23702782", "title": "Loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B increases IGF-I receptor tyrosine phosphorylation but does not rescue retinal defects in IRS2-deficient mice."}, {"abstract": "Recently we have shown that insulin fails to induce the phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the retina [Rajala et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 5637-5650], even though there is widespread expression of IRS-1 throughout the retina. These results suggest the expression of tissue-specific regulators in the retina. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a bovine retinal cDNA library with the cytoplasmic domain of retinal insulin receptor identified a novel member of the Grb7 gene family, Grb14. Phosphorylation prediction software indicated 6 out of 18 tyrosine residues were most likely to be phosphorylated. Out of six tyrosine phosphorylation sites, one of the tyrosine residues in Grb14 is present in a conserved sequence motif, FXNPXY. The NPXY motifs are recognized by proteins containing a domain known as phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) or phosphotyrosine-interacting domain (PID). The biological function of the PTB domain is to drive recruitment of signaling adapters such as IRS-1 or Shc to NPXpY (pY stands for phosphotyrosine) on activated receptor tyrosine kinases.

Yeast two-hybrid screening of a bovine retinal cDNA library with the cytoplasmic domain of retinal insulin receptor identified a novel member of the Grb7 gene family, Grb14. Phosphorylation prediction software indicated 6 out of 18 tyrosine residues were most likely to be phosphorylated. Out of six tyrosine phosphorylation sites, one of the tyrosine residues in Grb14 is present in a conserved sequence motif, FXNPXY. The NPXY motifs are recognized by proteins containing a domain known as phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) or phosphotyrosine-interacting domain (PID). The biological function of the PTB domain is to drive recruitment of signaling adapters such as IRS-1 or Shc to NPXpY (pY stands for phosphotyrosine) on activated receptor tyrosine kinases. We have made a novel finding that the PTB domain of IRS-1 binds to the NPXY motif of Grb14 in a phosphorylation-independent manner. In addition, Grb14-IRS-1 complexes are detected in lysates prepared from retina tissues. We suggest that the Grb14 NPXY motif could be acting as a dominant negative for IRS-1 functions in the retina, and this hypothesis is consistent with the recent study that Grb14-deficient mice exhibit enhanced IRS-1 phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase B. This is the first report describing the presence of the NPXY motif in Grb14 and binding of the PTB domain of IRS-1 in a phosphorylation-independent manner.", "score": 7, "id": "15924411", "title": "Identification of a NPXY motif in growth factor receptor-bound protein 14 (Grb14) and its interaction with the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of IRS-1."}, {"abstract": "Recently, we have shown that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in retina is regulated in vivo through light activation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit. In this study, we have cloned the 41 kDa cytoplasmic region of the retinal insulin receptor (IRbeta) and used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate the interaction between the p85 subunit of PI3K and the cytoplasmic region of IRbeta. Under conditions where IRbeta autophosphorylates, substitution of Y1322F and M1325P in IRbeta resulted in the abolition of p85 binding to the IRbeta, confirming that the p85 subunit of PI3K binds to Y1322. The binding site for p85 on IRbeta was also confirmed in the yeast three-hybrid system. Using the C-terminal region of IRbeta (amino acids 1293-1343 encompassing the YHTM motif) as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to yeast cells, we determined that the IRbeta-pYTHM motif interacts with p85. We also used retinal organ cultures to demonstrate insulin activation of the insulin receptor and subsequent binding of p85, measured through GST pull-down assays with p85 fusion proteins. Further, the Y960F mutant insulin receptor, which does not bind IRS-1, is capable of bringing down PI3K activity from retina lysates. On the other hand, in response to insulin, IRS-2 is able to interact with the p85 subunit of PI3K in the retina. These results suggest that multiple signaling pathways could regulate the PI3K activity and subsequent activation of Akt in the retina.", "score": 7, "id": "15134438", "title": "Interaction of the retinal insulin receptor beta-subunit with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase."}, {"abstract": "Diseases of aging produce many alterations in the retina, but changes in growth factor signaling in normal aging are less characterized. This study investigated modifications in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor (IGF-1R) signaling in the retina of Brown Norway x Fischer 344 F1 hybrid rats at 8, 22, and 32 months. Immunoblotting for proteins involved in IGF-1R signal transduction and electroretinograms were done to evaluate changes with aging. Aging produced a significant decrease in b-wave and oscillatory potential amplitudes in the retina. Aging produced increased phosphorylation of IGF-1R. Despite the increase in IGF-1R activity, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation was significantly decreased with increasing age. Akt activity was significantly decreased at 22 and 32 months of age, resulting in increased cleaved caspase 3 levels. The results suggest that regulation of IRS-1 phosphorylation may modulate apoptotic rates in the aging retina, potentially preventing activation of vascular endothelial cell growth factor.", "score": 5, "id": "19696229", "title": "Age-associated increase in cleaved caspase 3 despite phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor in the rat retina."}, {"abstract": "Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is a representative mediator of antioxidants and cytoprotectants against various stress stimuli including oxidants in vascular cells. Intensive insulin treatment can delay the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy and other vascularopathies, yet little is known about insulin regulation of anti-apoptotic and antioxidant molecules such as HO-1 in vascular cells. Intravitreous injection or in vitro addition of insulin increased HO-1 protein expression in rat retina and in cultured bovine retinal pericytes, retinal endothelial cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells. In bovine retinal pericytes, insulin induced mRNA and protein expression of HO-1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Using HO-1 promoter analysis, the luciferase reporter assay showed that induction of HO-1 expression by insulin is mediated by additional response elements in the ho-1 promoter gene, which was not responsive to antioxidants. Insulin-induced HO-1 mRNA expression through activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway without affecting ERK and p38 MAPK. Overexpression of an adenoviral vector of native IRS1, IRS2, and Akt dominant negative or small interfering RNA transfection of Akt1 and Akt2 targeted gene demonstrated that insulin regulated HO-1 expression via IRS1 and Akt2 pathway, selectively. Further, insulin treatment prevented H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB and caspase-8 activation and apoptosis via the IRS1/PI3K/Akt2/HO-1 pathway in the pericytes.

Irs2 was mainly localized to the outer plexiform layer as well as to photoreceptor inner segments. It was also seen in ganglion cells and inner plexiform layer but in smaller amounts. Compared with control littermates, Irs2 knock-out mice lose 10% of their photoreceptors 1 week after birth and up to 50% by 2 weeks of age as a result of increased apoptosis. The surviving photoreceptor cells developed short organized segments, which displayed proportionally diminished but otherwise normal electrical function. However, IGF1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was barely detected, and cleaved/activated caspase-3 was significantly elevated in isolated retinas of Irs2-/- mice. When diabetes was prevented, which allowed the Irs2-/- mice to survive for 2 years, most photoreceptor cells were lost by 16 months of age.

However, the mechanisms by which retinal neurites are segregated within the inner or outer plexiform layers are not known. We find that the transmembrane semaphorins Sema5A and Sema5B constrain neurites from multiple retinal neuron subtypes within the inner plexiform layer (IPL). In Sema5A\u207b/\u207b; Sema5B\u207b/\u207b mice, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and amacrine and bipolar cells exhibit severe defects leading to neurite mistargeting into the outer portions of the retina. These targeting abnormalities are more prominent in the outer (OFF) layers of the IPL and result in functional defects in select RGC response properties. Sema5A and Sema5B inhibit retinal neurite outgrowth through PlexinA1 and PlexinA3 receptors both in vitro and in vivo. These findings define a set of ligands and receptors required for the establishment of inner retinal lamination and function.", "score": 9, "id": "21835343", "title": "Class 5 transmembrane semaphorins control selective Mammalian retinal lamination and function."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>Increasing interest in the role of Class 3 Semaphorins (Sema3s) in plasticity and repair in the injured mammalian central nervous system prompted us to characterize changes in Sema3 expression after optic nerve (ON) injury.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>We used unilateral ON transection (ONT) and ON crush (ONC) models in conjunction with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and in situ hybridization (ISH) to characterize postinjury changes in the expression of the Sema3s and their receptors in the rat retina, optic nerve, and superior colliculus (SC).<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>We observed no changes in mRNA expression in axotomized retinas at 1 or 14 days after ONT, but there was a transient increase for Sema3b, Sema3f, L1cam, and Plxna3 at 3 days postinjury.

In Sema5A\u207b/\u207b; Sema5B\u207b/\u207b mice, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and amacrine and bipolar cells exhibit severe defects leading to neurite mistargeting into the outer portions of the retina. These targeting abnormalities are more prominent in the outer (OFF) layers of the IPL and result in functional defects in select RGC response properties. Sema5A and Sema5B inhibit retinal neurite outgrowth through PlexinA1 and PlexinA3 receptors both in vitro and in vivo.
