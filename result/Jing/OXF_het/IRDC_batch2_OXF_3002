"<b>BACKGROUND: </b>Maintaining the correct balance of proliferation versus differentiation in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) is essential for proper development of the retina. The cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 is expressed in RPCs, and mice with a targeted null allele at the cyclin D1 locus (Ccnd1-/-) have microphthalmia and hypocellular retinas, the latter phenotype attributed to reduced RPC proliferation and increased photoreceptor cell death during the postnatal period. How cyclin D1 influences RPC behavior, especially during the embryonic period, is unclear.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>In this study, we show that embryonic RPCs lacking cyclin D1 progress through the cell cycle at a slower rate and exit the cell cycle at a faster rate. Consistent with enhanced cell cycle exit, the relative proportions of cell types born in the embryonic period, such as retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptor cells, are increased. Unexpectedly, cyclin D1 deficiency decreases the proportions of other early born retinal neurons, namely horizontal cells and specific amacrine cell types. We also found that the laminar positioning of horizontal cells and other cell types is altered in the absence of cyclin D1. Genetically replacing cyclin D1 with cyclin D2 is not efficient at correcting the phenotypes due to the cyclin D1 deficiency, which suggests the D-cyclins are not fully redundant. Replacement with cyclin E or inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 restores the balance of RPCs and retinal cell types to more normal distributions, which suggests that regulation of the retinoblastoma pathway is an important function for cyclin D1 during embryonic retinal development.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>Our findings show that cyclin D1 has important roles in RPC cell cycle regulation and retinal histogenesis. The reduction in the RPC population due to a longer cell cycle time and to an enhanced rate of cell cycle exit are likely to be the primary factors driving retinal hypocellularity and altered output of precursor populations in the embryonic Ccnd1-/- retina.<br/>", "score": 10, "id": "19416500", "title": "Cyclin D1 fine-tunes the neurogenic output of embryonic retinal progenitor cells."}, {"abstract": "Retinal diseases are the leading causes of irreversible visual impairment and blindness in the developed countries. Human retina has limited regenerative power to replace cell loss. Stem cell replacement therapy has been proposed as a viable option. Previously, we have induced human adult periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) to the retinal lineage. In this study, we modified our induction protocol to direct human adult PDLSCs into retinal ganglion-like cells and determined the microRNA (miRNA) signature of this transdifferentiation process. The differentiated PDLSCs demonstrated the characteristics of functional neurons as they expressed neuronal and retinal ganglion cell markers (ATOH7, POU4F2, \u03b2-III tubulin, MAP2, TAU, NEUROD1 and SIX3), formed synapses and showed glutamate-induced calcium responses as well as spontaneous electrical activities. The global miRNA expression profiling identified 44 upregulated and 27 downregulated human miRNAs after retinal induction. Gene ontology analysis of the predicted miRNA target genes confirmed the transdifferentiation is closely related to neuronal differentiation processes. Furthermore, the expressions of 2 miRNA-targeted candidates, VEGF and PTEN, were significantly upregulated during the induction process. This study identified the transdifferentiation process of human adult stem cells into retinal ganglion-like cells and revealed the involvement of both genetic and miRNA regulatory mechanisms.", "score": 9, "id": "26549845", "title": "Transdifferentiation of periodontal ligament-derived stem cells into retinal ganglion-like cells and its microRNA signature."}, {"abstract": "Our current study focuses on the expression of two members of the onecut transcription factor family, Onecut1 (Oc1) and Onecut2 (Oc2), in the developing mouse retina. By immunofluorescence staining, we found that Oc1 and Oc2 had very similar expression patterns throughout retinal development. Both factors started to be expressed in the retina at around embryonic day (E) 11.5. At early stages (E11.5 and E12.5), they were expressed in both the neuroblast layer (NBL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL). As development progressed (from E14.5 to postnatal day [P] 0), expression diminished in the retinal progenitor cells and became more restricted to the GCL. By P5, Oc1 and Oc2 were expressed at very low levels in the GCL. By co-labeling with transcription factors known to be involved in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) development, we found that Oc1 and Oc2 had extensive overlap with Math5 in the NBL, and that they completely overlapped with Pou4f2 and Isl1 in the GCL, but only partially in the NBL. Co-labeling of Oc1 with cell cycle markers confirmed that Oc1 was expressed in both proliferating retinal progenitors and postmitotic retinal cells. In addition, we demonstrated that expression of Oc1 and Oc2 did not require Math5, Isl1, or Pou4f2. Thus, Oc1 and Oc2 may regulate the formation of RGCs in a pathway independent of Math5, Pou4f2, and Isl1. Furthermore, we showed that Oc1 and Oc2 were expressed in both developing and mature horizontal cells (HCs). Therefore the two factors may also function in the genesis and maintenance of HCs.", "score": 8, "id": "21830221", "title": "Onecut 1 and Onecut 2 are potential regulators of mouse retinal development."}, {"abstract": "Vertebrate retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) are pluripotent, but pass through competence states that progressively restrict their developmental potential (Cepko et al., 1996; Livesey and Cepko, 2001; Cayouette et al., 2006). In the rodent eye, seven retinal cell classes differentiate in overlapping waves, with RGCs, cone photoreceptors, horizontals, and amacrines forming predominantly before birth, and rod photoreceptors, bipolars, and M\u00fcller glia differentiating postnatally. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulate each retinal cell type (for review, see Livesey and Cepko, 2001). Here, we conditionally deleted the transcription factor Rbpj, a critical integrator of multiple Notch signals (Jarriault et al., 1995; Honjo, 1996; Kato et al., 1997; Han et al., 2002), during prenatal mouse retinal neurogenesis. Removal of Rbpj caused reduced proliferation, premature neuronal differentiation, apoptosis, and profound mispatterning. To determine the cell autonomous requirements for Rbpj during RGC and cone formation, we marked Cre-generated retinal lineages with GFP expression, which showed that Rbpj autonomously promotes RPC mitotic activity, and suppresses RGC and cone fates. In addition, the progressive loss of Rbpj-/- RPCs resulted in a diminished progenitor pool available for rod photoreceptor formation. This circumstance, along with the overproduction of Rbpj-/- cones, revealed that photoreceptor development is under homeostatic regulation. Finally, to understand how the Notch pathway regulates the simultaneous formation of multiple cell types, we compared the RGC and cone phenotypes of Rbpj to Notch1 (Jadhav et al., 2006b; Yaron et al., 2006), Notch3, and Hes1 mutants.

It has been postulated that specified RGCs subsequently influence the number and fate of the remaining progenitors to produce the rest of the retinal cell types. However, several genetic knockout models have argued against this developmental role for RGCs. Although it is known that RGCs secrete cellular factors implicated in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, until now, limited publications have shown that reductions in the RGC number cause significant changes in these processes. In this study, we observed that Math5 and Brn3b double null mice exhibited over a 99% reduction in the number of RGCs during development. This severe reduction of RGCs is accompanied by a drastic loss in the number of all other retinal cell types that was never seen before. Unlike Brn3b null or Math5 null animals, mice null for both alleles lack an optic nerve and have severe retinal dysfunction. Results of this study support the hypothesis that RGCs play a pivotal role in the late phase of mammalian retina development.", "score": 8, "id": "18321480", "title": "Near complete loss of retinal ganglion cells in the math5/brn3b double knockout elicits severe reductions of other cell types during retinal development."}, {"abstract": "Based on a variety of approaches, evidence suggests that different cell types in the vertebrate retina are generated by multipotential progenitors in response to interactions between cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic factors. The identity of some of the cellular determinants that mediate such interactions has emerged, shedding light on mechanisms underlying cell differentiation. For example, we know now that Notch signaling mediates the influence of the microenvironment on states of commitment of the progenitors by activating transcriptional repressors. Cell intrinsic factors such as the proneural basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain transcription factors regulate a network of genes necessary for cell differentiation and maturation. What is missing from this picture is the role of developmental chromatin remodeling in coordinating the expression of disparate classes of genes for the differentiation of retinal progenitors. Here we describe the role of Brm, an ATPase in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in the differentiation of retinal progenitors into retinal ganglion cells. Using the perturbation of expression and function analyses, we demonstrate that Brm promotes retinal ganglion cell differentiation by facilitating the expression and function of a key regulator of retinal ganglion cells, Brn3b, and the inhibition of Notch signaling. In addition, we demonstrate that Brm promotes cell cycle exit during retinal ganglion cell differentiation.

To better understand RGC development, we have previously constructed a gene regulatory network featuring a hierarchical cascade of transcription factors that ultimately controls the expression of downstream effector genes. This has revealed the existence of a Pou domain transcription factor, Pou4f2, that occupies a key node in the RGC gene regulatory network and that is essential for RGC differentiation. However, little is known about the genes that connect upstream regulatory genes, such as Pou4f2 with downstream effector genes responsible for RGC differentiation. The purpose of this study was to characterize the retinal function of eomesodermin (Eomes), a T-box transcription factor with previously unsuspected roles in retinogenesis. We show that Eomes is expressed in developing RGCs and is a mediator of Pou4f2 function. Pou4f2 directly regulates Eomes expression through a cis-regulatory element within a conserved retinal enhancer. Deleting Eomes in the developing retina causes defects reminiscent of those in Pou4f2(-/-) retinas. Moreover, myelin ensheathment in the optic nerves of Eomes(-/-) embryos is severely impaired, suggesting that Eomes regulates this process.

These deficits are coupled with marked reductions in mature ON- and OFF-bipolar (>76%), cholinergic amacrine (93%), and ganglion (71%) cells. Mosaic deletion of Isl1 permitted a chimeric analysis of \"wild-type\" cells in a predominantly Isl1-null environment, demonstrating a cell-autonomous role for Isl1 in rod bipolar and cholinergic amacrine development.

Expression of the ON- and OFF-bipolar cell differentiation factors Bhlhb4 and Vsx1, respectively, requires the presence of Isl1, whereas the early bipolar cell marker Prox1 initially did not.

We tested the hypothesis that M1 and non-M1 cells express Brn3 transcription factors differentially. The Brn3 family of class IV POU-domain transcription factors (Brn3a, Brn3b, and Brn3c) is involved in the regulation of differentiation, dendritic stratification, and axonal projection of retinal ganglion cells during development. By using double immunofluorescence for Brn3 transcription factors and melanopsin, and with elaborate morphometric analyses, we show in mouse retina that neither Brn3a nor Brn3c are expressed in ipRGCs. However, Brn3b is expressed in a subset of ipRGCs, particularly those with larger somas and lower melanopsin levels, suggesting that Brn3b is expressed preferentially in the non-M1 cells. By using dendritic stratification to distinguish M1 from non-M1 cells, we found that whereas nearly all non-M1 cells expressed Brn3b, a vast majority of the M1 cells were negative for Brn3b. Interestingly, in the small proportion of the M1 cells that did express Brn3b, the expression level of Brn3b was significantly lower than in the non-M1 cells.

The brn-3b expression in the zebrafish retina was consistent with a conserved role in differentiation and maintenance of RGCs. Expression was also observed in the optic tectum. Unexpectedly, brn-3b was prominently expressed in the migrating posterior lateral line primordium and larval neuromasts. For comparison, brn-3c expression was limited to the otic vesicle and was not detected in the lateral line during embryonic development. The expression of brn-3b in the mechanosensory lateral line of fish suggests a conserved function of a class IV POU domain transcription factor in sensory system development.", "score": 2, "id": "15042710", "title": "Developmental expression of the POU domain transcription factor Brn-3b (Pou4f2) in the lateral line and visual system of zebrafish."}, {"abstract": "POU-homeodomain and LIM-homeodomain transcription factors are expressed in developing projection neurons within retina, inner ear, dorsal root ganglion, and trigeminal ganglion, and play synergistic roles in their differentiation and survival.

To identify molecular markers, using CodeLink oligonucleotide arrays, gene expression was studied in 3 PPTs (2 pineocytomas and one pineoblastoma), 2 PTPRs, and one chordoid glioma, another rare tumor of the third ventricle.

The cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 is expressed in RPCs, and mice with a targeted null allele at the cyclin D1 locus (Ccnd1-/-) have microphthalmia and hypocellular retinas, the latter phenotype attributed to reduced RPC proliferation and increased photoreceptor cell death during the postnatal period. How cyclin D1 influences RPC behavior, especially during the embryonic period, is unclear.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>In this study, we show that embryonic RPCs lacking cyclin D1 progress through the cell cycle at a slower rate and exit the cell cycle at a faster rate. Consistent with enhanced cell cycle exit, the relative proportions of cell types born in the embryonic period, such as retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptor cells, are increased. Unexpectedly, cyclin D1 deficiency decreases the proportions of other early born retinal neurons, namely horizontal cells and specific amacrine cell types. We also found that the laminar positioning of horizontal cells and other cell types is altered in the absence of cyclin D1. Genetically replacing cyclin D1 with cyclin D2 is not efficient at correcting the phenotypes due to the cyclin D1 deficiency, which suggests the D-cyclins are not fully redundant. Replacement with cyclin E or inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 restores the balance of RPCs and retinal cell types to more normal distributions, which suggests that regulation of the retinoblastoma pathway is an important function for cyclin D1 during embryonic retinal development.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>Our findings show that cyclin D1 has important roles in RPC cell cycle regulation and retinal histogenesis.

In addition, the progressive loss of Rbpj-/- RPCs resulted in a diminished progenitor pool available for rod photoreceptor formation. This circumstance, along with the overproduction of Rbpj-/- cones, revealed that photoreceptor development is under homeostatic regulation.

We show that Eomes is expressed in developing RGCs and is a mediator of Pou4f2 function. Pou4f2 directly regulates Eomes expression through a cis-regulatory element within a conserved retinal enhancer. Deleting Eomes in the developing retina causes defects reminiscent of those in Pou4f2(-/-) retinas.

Our objective was to develop a robust genetically engineered adult mouse model for RGC loss and optic nerve degeneration based on genetic ablation. To achieve this, we took advantage of Pou4f2 (Brn3b), a gene activated immediately as RGCs begin to differentiate and expressed throughout life. We generated adult mice whose genomes harbored a conditional Pou4f2 allele containing a floxed-lacZ-stop-diphtheria toxin A cassette and a CAGG-Cre-ER transgene. In this bigenic model, Cre recombinase is fused to a modified estrogen nuclear receptor in which the estrogen-binding domain binds preferentially to the estrogen agonist tamoxifen rather than to endogenous estradiol. Upon binding to the estrogen-binding domain, tamoxifen derepresses Cre recombinase, leading to the efficient genomic deletion of the floxed-lacZ-stop DNA sequence and expression of diphtheria toxin A. Tamoxifen administered to adult mice at different ages by intraperitoneal injection led to rapid RGC loss, reactive gliosis, progressive degradation of the optic nerve over a period of several months, and visual impairment. Perhaps more reflective of human disease, partial loss of RGCs was achieved by modulating the tamoxifen treatment.

We also assessed macular thickness related to HLA-B27 presence and to recurrence, since these issues have been almost unexplored by previous optical coherence tomography (OCT) studies.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Patients with AU were prospectively included and macular thickness was measured with OCT initially and on follow up. Macular thickness in patients' affected eyes (n = 30) as well as in their quiet fellow-eyes (n = 28) was compared with eyes of age- and gender matched controls. Inter-ocular differences in macular thickness between AU affected eyes and their fellow-eyes were assessed in patients (n = 28), also in a subgroup with visual acuity \u2265 0.8 (n = 23) by one-sample Student's t-tests. Inter-ocular differences were also assessed related to HLA-B27 presence and related to the status of current AU episode (initial or relapse).<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Subclinical MT is present in both quiet fellow-eyes and AU-affected eyes of patients. MT was found in most cases of AU, even in phakic eyes with good VA. There was a larger increase in macular thickness in HLA-B27-positive than in HLA-B27-negative patients. No differences in macular thickness were found between patients with their first AU episode and patients with recurrent episodes.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>MT probably reflects systemic immune-mediated response to the inflammatory disorder in AU, and it is possible that HLA-B27-related factors are involved in the pathogenesis of AU.

This makes the diagnosis more difficult. Early diagnosis is important, as the prognosis is better if therapy is started early. New methods such as ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) can improve the characterisation and diagnosis of uveitis. Our purpose was to present our experience with these new methods as well as HLA-B51 testing in the appraisal of patients with Beh\u00e7et's uveitis.<br/><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS: </b>Patients seen by the authors between 1997 and 2001 with Beh\u00e7et's uveitis or suspected Beh\u00e7et's uveitis and who underwent ICG angiography or UBM were included.

Fluorescein angiography showed moderate to severe diffuse retinal vasculitis compatible with Beh\u00e7et's uveitis in all cases.

Relevant inclusion criteria are age over 18\u00a0years and waiting for penetrating or endothelial lamellar keratoplasty. The most important exclusion criteria are abuse of medication and/or drugs and an anticipated waiting time for an HLA match longer than 6\u00a0months.

However, immunological graft reactions may induce irreversible graft failure in a substantial percentage. Repeat keratoplasties in turn are associated with increased risk of graft failure and possibly irreversible blindness. Topical as well as systemic immunosuppressants are administered for prophylaxis. However, severe adverse effects limit long-term usage. By contrast, matching for transplantation antigens might be effective for a long time.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>FANCY is a prospective, controlled, randomised, double-blind, multi-centre clinical trial with two parallel arms. The primary objective is to evaluate superiority of the proposed HLA matching strategy in comparison to random graft assignment with respect to the primary endpoint 'time to first endothelial graft rejection'. Relevant inclusion criteria are age over 18\u00a0years and waiting for penetrating or endothelial lamellar keratoplasty. The most important exclusion criteria are abuse of medication and/or drugs and an anticipated waiting time for an HLA match longer than 6\u00a0months. After randomisation, patients either receive a HLA-matched graft (experimental intervention) or a random graft (control intervention). The calculated sample size is 620 patients. The trial started in 2009 with a recruitment period of 24\u00a0months. A total of 654 patients were included during this time.<br/><b>DISCUSSION: </b>The primary goal of FANCY is to assess whether histocompatibility matching is feasible and effective in the broad clinical routine. However, during the course of the trial, the landscape of keratoplasty changed due to the rise of Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK). Nowadays, immune reactions are confined mostly to the 'high-risk' subgroups.

The main symptoms of CSK are progressive, bilateral vascularisation, fibrous tissue formation and pigmentation of the anterior corneal stroma. Although CSK is found in many breeds it is most prevalent in German Shepherd dogs (GSDs). Since Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II is associated with several autoimmune diseases in dogs we investigated the possible role of DLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 in GSDs affected with CSK. Our study population included 25 healthy controls and 30 CSK dogs. Most of the affected dogs were females suggesting a female predisposition. We identified 11 unevenly distributed haplotypes of which DLA-DRB1*01501/DQA1*00601/DQB1*00301 was significantly associated with the CSK dogs (OR=2.67, CI=1.17-6.44, p=0.02). We also found that overall homozygosity of MHC class II increases risk for CSK (OR=4.37, CI=1.27-18.46, p=0.02) and homozygosity of the risk haplotype by over eight-fold (OR=8.5, 95% CI=1.4-224, p=0.017).

This large spectrum of clinical manifestations of the disease is an indication of the complexity of the pathogenesis of onchocerciasis and suggests that many interacting factors might influence the clinical features of the disease. The present study has focused on the heterogenicity of the host immune response as a plausible explanation for differences in clinical manifestations of the infection. Host genetic factors, namely HLA genes, might play an important role in determining the nature of the immune response mounted against the parasite Onchocerca volvulus, and thus the development of different manifestations of the infection. Genetic diversity of onchocerciasis was assessed in different endemic foci in Cameroon. In order to investigate the possibility that the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes might be associated with the different clinical types of onchocerciasis, 146 subjects living in three endemic areas of Cameroon were studied. They were classified in four groups: A (asymptomatic subjects), P (putatively immune subjects) L (patients with localised disease) and G (patients with generalised disease). The four groups differed in the distribution of HLA class II alleles as determined by Direct Heteroduplex Analysis. On the one hand, allele HLA-DQA1*0501 appeared to be associated with protection against severe onchocerciasis; on the other, allele HLA-DQB1*0201 might play an important role in the severe form of the disease.", "score": 1, "id": "10399595", "title": "[Variations under genetic control of onchocerca infection as a function of clinical profile in the endemic center of Cameroon]."}, {"abstract": "It has been suggested that the provision of HLA matched tissue for corneal transplantation would be beneficial for graft survival especially in high risk patients.
