signaling by adding O-glucose residues to the Notch extracellular domain. Rumi has other predicted targets including Crumbs (Crb) and Eyes shut (Eys), both of which are involved in photoreceptor development. However, whether Rumi is required for the function of Crb and Eys remains unknown. Here we report that in the absence of Rumi or its enzymatic activity, several rhabdomeres in each ommatidium fail to separate from one another in a Notch-independent manner. Mass spectral analysis indicates the presence of O-glucose on Crb and Eys. However, mutating all O-glucosylation sites in a crb knock-in allele does not cause rhabdomere attachment, ruling out Crb as a biologically-relevant Rumi target in this process. In contrast, eys and rumi exhibit a dosage-sensitive genetic interaction. In addition, although in wild-type ommatidia most of the Eys protein is found in the inter-rhabdomeral space (IRS), in rumi mutants a significant fraction of Eys remains in the photoreceptor cells. The intracellular accumulation of Eys and the IRS defect worsen in rumi mutants raised at a higher temperature, and are accompanied by a \u223c50% decrease in the total level of Eys. Moreover, removing one copy of an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone enhances the rhabdomere attachment in rumi mutant animals. Altogether, our data suggest that O-glucosylation of Eys by Rumi ensures rhabdomere separation by promoting proper Eys folding and stability in a critical time window during the mid-pupal stage. Human EYS, which is mutated in patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, also harbors multiple Rumi target sites.

Previous work in HD patients and animal models of the disease has also highlighted retinal involvement. This study characterised the changes in retinal structure and function early within the progression of disease using the R6/1 mouse model of HD. The retinal phenotype was observed to occur at the same time in the disease process as other neurological deficits such as motor dysfunction (by 13 weeks of age). There was a specific functional deficit in cone response to the electroretinogram and using immunocytochemical techniques, this dysfunction was found to be likely due to a progressive and complete loss of cone opsin and transducin protein expression by 20 weeks of age. In addition, there was an increase in M\u00fcller cell gliosis and the presence of ectopic rod photoreceptor terminals. This retinal remodelling is also observed in downstream neurons, namely the rod and cone bipolar cells. While R6/1 mice exhibit significant retinal pathology simultaneously with other more classical HD alterations, this doesn't lead to extensive cell loss. These findings suggest that in HD, cone photoreceptors are initially targeted, possibly via dysregulation of protein expression or trafficking and that this process is subsequently accompanied by increased retinal stress and neuronal remodelling also involving the rod pathway. As retinal structure and connectivity are well characterised, the retina may provide a useful model tissue in which to characterise the mechanisms important in the development of neuronal pathology in HD.", "score": 9, "id": "22198376", "title": "Retinal dysfunction, photoreceptor protein dysregulation and neuronal remodelling in the R6/1 mouse model of Huntington's disease."}, {"abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the medium-size GABAergic neurons of striatum. The R6/2 mouse line is one of the most widely used animal models of HD. Previously the hallmarks of HD-related pathology have been detected in photoreceptors and interneurons of R6/2 mouse retina. Here we aimed to explore the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and functional integrity of distinct retinal cell populations in R6/2 mice. The pattern electroretinography (PERG) signal was lost at the age of 8 weeks in R6/2 mice in contrast to the situation in wild-type (WT) littermates. This defect may be attributable to a major reduction in photopic ERG responses in R6/2 mice which was more evident in b- than a-wave amplitudes. At the age of 4 weeks R6/2 mice had predominantly the soluble form of mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) in the RGC layer cells, whereas the aggregated form of mHtt was found in the majority of those cells from the 12-week-old R6/2 mice and onwards. Retinal astrocytes did not contain mHtt deposits. The total numbers of RGC layer cells, retinal astrocytes as well as optic nerve axons did not differ between 18-week-old R6/2 mice and their WT controls. Our data indicate that mHtt deposition does not cause RGC degeneration or retinal astrocyte loss in R6/2 mice even at a late stage of HD-related pathology. However, due to functional deficits in the rod- and cone-pathways, the R6/2 mice suffer progressive deficits in visual capabilities starting as early as 4 weeks; at 8 weeks there is severe impairment.

We previously described a SCA7 transgenic retinal model expressing mutant full length ataxin-7 in rod photoreceptors. These mice develop a severe and characteristic retinopathy. We show here that R6 transgenic mice, which reproduce many features of HD, express mutant huntingtin in the retina leading to strong vision deficiencies and retinal dystrophy.

These abnormalities are reminiscent of other retinal degeneration phenotypes (in particular rd7/rd7 mice) where photoreceptor cell loss occurs.

It is caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin (Htt). The development of therapies for HD and other neurodegenerative diseases has been hampered by multiple factors, including the lack of clear therapeutic targets, and the cost and complexity of testing lead compounds in vivo. The R6/2 HD mouse model is widely used for pre-clinical trials because of its progressive and robust neural dysfunction, which includes retinal degeneration. Profilin-1 is a Htt binding protein that inhibits Htt aggregation. Its binding to Htt is regulated by the rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which phosphorylates profilin at Ser-137. ROCK is thus a therapeutic target in HD. The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 reduces Htt toxicity in fly and mouse models. Here we characterized the progressive retinopathy of R6/2 mice between 6-19 weeks of age to determine an optimal treatment window. We then tested a clinically approved ROCK inhibitor, HA-1077, administered intravitreally via liposome-mediated drug delivery. HA-1077 increased photopic and flicker ERG response amplitudes in R6/2 mice, but not in wild-type littermate controls.

Cellular taurine accumulation occurs by an osmotically induced, protein kinase C (PKC)-regulated Na(+)-taurine cotransporter (hTT). The effects of ambient glucose on taurine content, hTT activity, and hTT gene expression were therefore evaluated in low and high AR-expressing human retinal pigment epithelial cell lines. In low AR-expressing cells, 20 mM glucose decreased taurine content, hTT transporter activity, and mRNA levels, and these effects were unaffected by AR inhibition (ARI). In these cells, the inhibitory effects of high glucose on hTT appeared to be posttranscriptionally mediated, because 20 mM glucose decreased hTT mRNA stability without affecting hTT transcriptional rate. Inhibition of PKC overcame the decrease in hTT activity in high glucose-exposed cells. In high AR-expressing cells, prolonged exposure to 20 mM glucose resulted in intracellular taurine depletion, which paralleled sorbitol accumulation and was prevented by ARI. In these cells exposed to 5 mM glucose, hTT mRNA abundance was decreased and declined further in 20 mM glucose but was corrected by ARI. In 5 mM glucose, hTT transcriptional rate was markedly decreased in high AR-expressing cells, did not decline further in 20 mM glucose, but was increased by ARI to levels above those observed in low AR-expressing cells. Therefore, glucose rapidly and specifically decreases taurine content, hTT activity, and mRNA abundance by AR-unrelated and AR-related posttranscriptional and transcriptional mechanisms.", "score": 2, "id": "10516137", "title": "Downregulation of the human taurine transporter by glucose in cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells."}, {"abstract": "The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4; synonyms, SERT, 5-HTT) is expressed much more broadly during development than in adulthood.

Two reporter mouse lines, ROSA26R and the Tau(mGFP), allowed to map all the cells that express SERT at any point during development. Combined LacZ histochemistry and GFP immunolabelling showed neuronal cell bodies and axon fiber tracts. Earliest recombination in embryos was visible in the periphery in the heart and liver by E10.5 followed by recombination in the brain in raphe serotonergic neurons by E12.5. Further, recombination in non-serotonin neurons was visible in the choroid plexus, roof plate, and neural crest derivatives; by E15.5, recombination was found in the dorsal thalamus, cingulate cortex, CA3 field of the hippocampus, retinal ganglion cells, superior olivary nucleus and cochlear nucleus.

However, similarly isolated IBs did not, thus suggesting that IB formation is protective by sequestering smaller inhibitory aggregates. Accordingly, proteasome-activity assays in IB-containing mouse brain homogenates did not show decreased activity. On the contrary, some of the endoproteolytic proteasome activities increased, probably due to altered subunit composition. However, activity was found decreased in postmortem human HD tissue. Finally, evidence supporting the hypothesis was found in HD cell models expressing fluorescent ubiquitin-proteasome system reporters but not in retina of SCA-7 mice with similar reporters.

Previous work in HD patients and animal models of the disease has also highlighted retinal involvement. This study characterised the changes in retinal structure and function early within the progression of disease using the R6/1 mouse model of HD. The retinal phenotype was observed to occur at the same time in the disease process as other neurological deficits such as motor dysfunction (by 13 weeks of age). There was a specific functional deficit in cone response to the electroretinogram and using immunocytochemical techniques, this dysfunction was found to be likely due to a progressive and complete loss of cone opsin and transducin protein expression by 20 weeks of age. In addition, there was an increase in M\u00fcller cell gliosis and the presence of ectopic rod photoreceptor terminals. This retinal remodelling is also observed in downstream neurons, namely the rod and cone bipolar cells. While R6/1 mice exhibit significant retinal pathology simultaneously with other more classical HD alterations, this doesn't lead to extensive cell loss. These findings suggest that in HD, cone photoreceptors are initially targeted, possibly via dysregulation of protein expression or trafficking and that this process is subsequently accompanied by increased retinal stress and neuronal remodelling also involving the rod pathway.

Here we aimed to explore the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and functional integrity of distinct retinal cell populations in R6/2 mice. The pattern electroretinography (PERG) signal was lost at the age of 8 weeks in R6/2 mice in contrast to the situation in wild-type (WT) littermates. This defect may be attributable to a major reduction in photopic ERG responses in R6/2 mice which was more evident in b- than a-wave amplitudes. At the age of 4 weeks R6/2 mice had predominantly the soluble form of mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) in the RGC layer cells, whereas the aggregated form of mHtt was found in the majority of those cells from the 12-week-old R6/2 mice and onwards. Retinal astrocytes did not contain mHtt deposits. The total numbers of RGC layer cells, retinal astrocytes as well as optic nerve axons did not differ between 18-week-old R6/2 mice and their WT controls. Our data indicate that mHtt deposition does not cause RGC degeneration or retinal astrocyte loss in R6/2 mice even at a late stage of HD-related pathology. However, due to functional deficits in the rod- and cone-pathways, the R6/2 mice suffer progressive deficits in visual capabilities starting as early as 4 weeks; at 8 weeks there is severe impairment.

The development of therapies for HD and other neurodegenerative diseases has been hampered by multiple factors, including the lack of clear therapeutic targets, and the cost and complexity of testing lead compounds in vivo. The R6/2 HD mouse model is widely used for pre-clinical trials because of its progressive and robust neural dysfunction, which includes retinal degeneration. Profilin-1 is a Htt binding protein that inhibits Htt aggregation. Its binding to Htt is regulated by the rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which phosphorylates profilin at Ser-137. ROCK is thus a therapeutic target in HD. The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 reduces Htt toxicity in fly and mouse models. Here we characterized the progressive retinopathy of R6/2 mice between 6-19 weeks of age to determine an optimal treatment window. We then tested a clinically approved ROCK inhibitor, HA-1077, administered intravitreally via liposome-mediated drug delivery. HA-1077 increased photopic and flicker ERG response amplitudes in R6/2 mice, but not in wild-type littermate controls.

The effects of ambient glucose on taurine content, hTT activity, and hTT gene expression were therefore evaluated in low and high AR-expressing human retinal pigment epithelial cell lines. In low AR-expressing cells, 20 mM glucose decreased taurine content, hTT transporter activity, and mRNA levels, and these effects were unaffected by AR inhibition (ARI). In these cells, the inhibitory effects of high glucose on hTT appeared to be posttranscriptionally mediated, because 20 mM glucose decreased hTT mRNA stability without affecting hTT transcriptional rate. Inhibition of PKC overcame the decrease in hTT activity in high glucose-exposed cells. In high AR-expressing cells, prolonged exposure to 20 mM glucose resulted in intracellular taurine depletion, which paralleled sorbitol accumulation and was prevented by ARI. In these cells exposed to 5 mM glucose, hTT mRNA abundance was decreased and declined further in 20 mM glucose but was corrected by ARI. In 5 mM glucose, hTT transcriptional rate was markedly decreased in high AR-expressing cells, did not decline further in 20 mM glucose, but was increased by ARI to levels above those observed in low AR-expressing cells.
