The primary objective is to evaluate superiority of the proposed HLA matching strategy in comparison to random graft assignment with respect to the primary endpoint 'time to first endothelial graft rejection'. Relevant inclusion criteria are age over 18\u00a0years and waiting for penetrating or endothelial lamellar keratoplasty. The most important exclusion criteria are abuse of medication and/or drugs and an anticipated waiting time for an HLA match longer than 6\u00a0months. After randomisation, patients either receive a HLA-matched graft (experimental intervention) or a random graft (control intervention). The calculated sample size is 620 patients.

Major symptoms include oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcerations, skin lesions, and ocular lesions. Despite afflicting many systems, ocular complications of BD are some of the more devastating for the patient and their quality of life. Eye involvement, which affects 60-80 % of BD patients, is characterized in its more severe form by posterior or panuveitis including occlusive retinal vasculitis. While pathogenesis of BD remains complex, association with Class I MHC (HLA-B*51) predisposing to inflammation with engagement of the innate-immune system (neutrophils, NK cells), and perpetuated by the adaptive T cell responses against infectious- and/or auto-antigens. Despite the choice of conventional immunosuppressive therapies available, only recently with the advent of biologic therapy has visual prognosis and outcomes been substantially and favorably altered. For example, both interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 antagonists deliver promising results and for the first time improve prognosis. With IFN-\u03b1 therapy, durable remissions of uveitis can be achieved and lead to drug-free remission. Similarly, anti-TNF therapy with infliximab is reported to be rapidly effective in inducing and maintaining remission. Most recently, rising evidence reports on the use of adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab, while use of anti-interleukin (IL)-1 agents (anakinra, canakinumab, gevokizumab), IL-6 blockers (tocilizumab), and rituximab (depleting anti-CD20 antibody) is also increasing. The aim of this review is to provide evidence for the role of conventional therapies combined with evidence for advantages and disadvantages of biologic therapies in the treatment of ocular BD.

This makes the diagnosis more difficult. Early diagnosis is important, as the prognosis is better if therapy is started early. New methods such as ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) can improve the characterisation and diagnosis of uveitis. Our purpose was to present our experience with these new methods as well as HLA-B51 testing in the appraisal of patients with Beh\u00e7et's uveitis.<br/><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS: </b>Patients seen by the authors between 1997 and 2001 with Beh\u00e7et's uveitis or suspected Beh\u00e7et's uveitis and who underwent ICG angiography or UBM were included.

Mutations in USH type 1 genes cause the most severe form of USH. In USH1 patients, congenital deafness is combined with a pre-pubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and severe vestibular dysfunctions. Those with USH2 have moderate to severe congenital hearing loss, non-vestibular dysfunction and a later onset of RP. USH3 is characterized by variable RP and vestibular dysfunction combined with progressive hearing loss. The gene products of eight identified USH genes belong to different protein classes and families. There are five known USH1 molecules: the molecular motor myosin VIIa (USH1B); the two cell-cell adhesion cadherin proteins, cadherin 23 (USH1D) and protocadherin 15, (USH1F) and the scaffold proteins, harmonin (USH1C) and SANS (USH1G).

A mutation in any of these genes e.g. CDH23, CLRN1, GPR98, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C, USH1G, USH2A and DFNB31 can result in Usher syndrome or non-syndromic deafness.

Therefore in the current study Clarin-1 and GPR98 proteins have been analyzed for signal peptide, domains and motifs. Clarin-1 protein was found to be without any signal peptide and consists of prokar lipoprotein domain. Clarin-1 is classified within claudin 2 super family and consists of twelve motifs.

The heterogeneity of Usher syndrome. Vth Int. Conf. Birth Defects, Montreal; Petit, C., 2001. Usher syndrome: from genetics to pathogenesis. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2, 271-297). Mutations in USH type 1 genes cause the most severe form of USH. In USH1 patients, congenital deafness is combined with a pre-pubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and severe vestibular dysfunctions. Those with USH2 have moderate to severe congenital hearing loss, non-vestibular dysfunction and a later onset of RP. USH3 is characterized by variable RP and vestibular dysfunction combined with progressive hearing loss. The gene products of eight identified USH genes belong to different protein classes and families. There are five known USH1 molecules: the molecular motor myosin VIIa (USH1B); the two cell-cell adhesion cadherin proteins, cadherin 23 (USH1D) and protocadherin 15, (USH1F) and the scaffold proteins, harmonin (USH1C) and SANS (USH1G). In addition, two USH2 genes and one USH3A gene have been identified. The two USH2 genes code for the transmembrane protein USH2A, also termed USH2A (\"usherin\") and the G-protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptor VLGR1b (USH2C), respectively, whereas the USH3A gene encodes clarin-1, a member of the clarin family which exhibits 4-transmembrane domains. Molecular analysis of USH1 protein function revealed that all five USH1 proteins are integrated into a protein network via binding to PDZ domains in the USH1C protein harmonin. Furthermore, this scaffold function of harmonin is supported by the USH1G protein SANS. Recently, we have shown that the USH2 proteins USH2A and VLGR1b as well as the candidate for USH2B, the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter NBC3, are also integrated into this USH protein network. In the inner ear, these interactions are essential for the differentiation of hair cell stereocilia but may also participate in the mechano-electrical signal transduction and the synaptic function of maturated hair cells. In the retina, the co-expression of all USH1 and USH2 proteins at the synapse of photoreceptor cells indicates that they are organized in an USH protein network there. The identification of the USH protein network indicates a common pathophysiological pathway in USH.

Many IPDs exhibit substantial phenotypic variability, but the basis is usually unknown. Mutations in MERTK cause recessive IPD phenotypes associated with the RP38 locus. We have identified a murine genetic modifier of Mertk-associated photoreceptor degeneration, the C57BL/6 (B6) allele of which acts as a suppressor. Photoreceptors degenerate rapidly in Mertk-deficient animals homozygous for the 129P2/Ola (129) modifier allele, whereas animals heterozygous for B6 and 129 modifier alleles exhibit an unusual intermixing of degenerating and preserved retinal regions, with females more severely affected than males. Mertk-deficient mice homozygous for the B6 modifier allele display degeneration only in the far periphery, even at 8 months of age, and have improved retinal function compared to animals homozygous for the 129 allele. We genetically mapped the modifier to an approximately 2-megabase critical interval that includes Tyro3, a paralog of Mertk. Tyro3 expression in the outer retina varies with modifier genotype in a manner characteristic of a cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), with the B6 allele conferring an approximately three-fold higher expression level. Loss of Tyro3 function accelerates the pace of photoreceptor degeneration in Mertk knockout mice, and TYRO3 protein is more abundant in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) adjacent to preserved central retinal regions of Mertk knockout mice homozygous for the B6 modifier allele. Endogenous human TYRO3 protein co-localizes with nascent photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagosomes in a primary RPE cell culture assay, and expression of murine Tyro3 in cultured cells stimulates phagocytic ingestion of POS. Our findings demonstrate that Tyro3 gene dosage modulates Mertk-associated retinal degeneration, provide strong evidence for a direct role for TYRO3 in RPE phagocytosis, and suggest that an eQTL can modify a recessive IPD.", "score": 7, "id": "26656104", "title": "Tyro3 Modulates Mertk-Associated Retinal Degeneration."}, {"abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a highly specialized CNS tissue that plays crucial roles in retinal homeostasis. Age-related morphological changes in the RPE have been associated with retinal degenerative disorders; our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remains incomplete. Here we report on a key role of Klotho (Kl), an aging-suppressor gene, in retinal health and RPE physiology. Kl(-/-) mice show RPE and photoreceptor degeneration, reduced pigment synthesis in the RPE, and impaired phagocytosis of the outer segment of the photoreceptors. Klotho protein (KL) is expressed in primary cultured human RPE, and regulates pigment synthesis by increasing the expression of MITF (microphthalmia transcription factor) and TYR (tyrosinase), two pivotal genes in melanogenesis. Importantly, KL increases phagocytosis in cultured RPE by inducing gene expression of MERTK/AXL/TYRO3. These effects of KL are mediated through cAMP-PKA-dependent phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB. In cultured human RPE, KL increases the l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine synthesis and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion from basal membrane by inhibiting IGF-1 signaling and VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation. KL also regulates the expression of stress-related genes in RPE, lowers the production of reactive oxygen species, and thereby, protects RPE from oxidative stress. Together, our results demonstrate a critical function for KL in mouse retinal health in vivo, and a protective role toward human RPE cells in vitro.

Mertk elimination nearly abolished macrophage apoptotic cell phagocytosis; elimination of Axl, Tyro3, or both, reduced macrophage phagocytosis by approximately half, indicating that these also play a role. In contrast, apoptotic cell clearance in splenic and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) is prolonged compared with macrophages and relied primarily on Axl and Tyro3. The slower ingestion may be due to lower DC expression of Axl and Tyro3 or absence of GAS6 expression, a known ligand for this receptor family.

Likewise, clearance of apoptotic thymocytes in vivo was dramatically reduced in mertk(kd) mice, but was normal in axl/tyro3(-/-) mice. Thus, cell and organ type specificity is clearly delineated, with DCs relying on Axl and Tyro3, retina and thymus requiring Mertk, and macrophages exhibiting an interaction that involves all three family members.

Many IPDs exhibit substantial phenotypic variability, but the basis is usually unknown. Mutations in MERTK cause recessive IPD phenotypes associated with the RP38 locus. We have identified a murine genetic modifier of Mertk-associated photoreceptor degeneration, the C57BL/6 (B6) allele of which acts as a suppressor. Photoreceptors degenerate rapidly in Mertk-deficient animals homozygous for the 129P2/Ola (129) modifier allele, whereas animals heterozygous for B6 and 129 modifier alleles exhibit an unusual intermixing of degenerating and preserved retinal regions, with females more severely affected than males. Mertk-deficient mice homozygous for the B6 modifier allele display degeneration only in the far periphery, even at 8 months of age, and have improved retinal function compared to animals homozygous for the 129 allele. We genetically mapped the modifier to an approximately 2-megabase critical interval that includes Tyro3, a paralog of Mertk. Tyro3 expression in the outer retina varies with modifier genotype in a manner characteristic of a cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), with the B6 allele conferring an approximately three-fold higher expression level. Loss of Tyro3 function accelerates the pace of photoreceptor degeneration in Mertk knockout mice, and TYRO3 protein is more abundant in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) adjacent to preserved central retinal regions of Mertk knockout mice homozygous for the B6 modifier allele. Endogenous human TYRO3 protein co-localizes with nascent photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagosomes in a primary RPE cell culture assay, and expression of murine Tyro3 in cultured cells stimulates phagocytic ingestion of POS.

Age-related morphological changes in the RPE have been associated with retinal degenerative disorders; our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remains incomplete. Here we report on a key role of Klotho (Kl), an aging-suppressor gene, in retinal health and RPE physiology. Kl(-/-) mice show RPE and photoreceptor degeneration, reduced pigment synthesis in the RPE, and impaired phagocytosis of the outer segment of the photoreceptors. Klotho protein (KL) is expressed in primary cultured human RPE, and regulates pigment synthesis by increasing the expression of MITF (microphthalmia transcription factor) and TYR (tyrosinase), two pivotal genes in melanogenesis. Importantly, KL increases phagocytosis in cultured RPE by inducing gene expression of MERTK/AXL/TYRO3. These effects of KL are mediated through cAMP-PKA-dependent phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB. In cultured human RPE, KL increases the l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine synthesis and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion from basal membrane by inhibiting IGF-1 signaling and VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation. KL also regulates the expression of stress-related genes in RPE, lowers the production of reactive oxygen species, and thereby, protects RPE from oxidative stress. Together, our results demonstrate a critical function for KL in mouse retinal health in vivo, and a protective role toward human RPE cells in vitro.

Mertk elimination nearly abolished macrophage apoptotic cell phagocytosis; elimination of Axl, Tyro3, or both, reduced macrophage phagocytosis by approximately half, indicating that these also play a role. In contrast, apoptotic cell clearance in splenic and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) is prolonged compared with macrophages and relied primarily on Axl and Tyro3. The slower ingestion may be due to lower DC expression of Axl and Tyro3 or absence of GAS6 expression, a known ligand for this receptor family.
