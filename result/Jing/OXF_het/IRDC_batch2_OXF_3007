Three weeks after vector delivery, EAU was induced with a subcutaneous injection of a mixture of interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) peptide with CFA. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Retinal function was evaluated with electroretinography (ERG). We found that the expression of MIF and its two receptors CD74 and CD44 was increased in the EAU mouse retina. Compared to AAV8.CBA.eGFP-injected and untreated EAU mice, the level of proinflammatory cytokines, the expression of Notch1, Notch4, delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), Notch receptor intracellular domain (NICD) and hairy enhancer of split-1 (Hes-1) increased, but the ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes decreased in AAV8.CBA.MIF-injected EAU mice. The Notch inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) reduced the expression of NICD, Hes-1 and proinflammatory cytokines. Further, a MIF antagonist ISO-1 attenuated intraocular inflammation, and inhibited the differentiation of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 in EAU mice. We demonstrated that over-expression of MIF exaggerated ocular inflammation, which was associated with the activation of the Notch signalling. The expression of both MIF and its receptors are elevated in EAU mice. Over-expression of MIF exaggerates ocular inflammation, and this exaggerated inflammation is associated with the activation of the Notch signalling and Notch pathway.

Patients with thin basement membrane (BM) disease do not have extrarenal manifestations, while those with Alport syndrome often present with hearing loss, anterior lenticonus, and dot-and-fleck retinopathy.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>We performed a phenotypic study and a candidate gene approach in a four-generation family presenting with autosomal-dominant hematuria associated with extrarenal manifestations. Renal biopsy was analyzed for determination of BM thickness and expression of chains of type IV collagen. Linkage to 18 candidate genes/loci was investigated using polymorphic microsatellite markers.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>In all affected patients, hematuria without proteinuria was associated with muscular contractures and retinal arterial tortuosities responsible for retinal hemorrhages. Cardiac arrhythmia, Raynaud phenomena, and brain MRI abnormalities were also observed. Despite the presence of red cells in tubule sections, no glomerular abnormalities were found by electron microscopy. Expression of type IV collagen chains and glomerular BM thickness was normal. We searched for a molecular defect affecting either BM or angiogenesis. Linkage analyses of genes encoding BM components (COL4A3/COL4A4, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3, FBLN1), and angiogenic factors or their receptors (VHL, ANPT1, ANPT2, TIE, TEK, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, NOTCH4, DLL4, JAG1, JAG2) and of the facio-sapulo-humeral dystrophy and 3q21 loci failed to show segregation of the disease with those gene loci.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>We have identified a new inherited hematuria syndrome associated with retinal vessel tortuosities and contractures.

Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region and two known AMD-associated SNPs in CFH (rs800292) and HTRA1 (rs11200638) were genotyped in a Han Chinese cohort composed of 490 neovascular AMD patients, 419 PCV patients and 1316 controls.

Dll4 mRNA is strongly expressed in endothelial cells at the very tips of growing vessels ('tip cells') and also in arteries, where it is expressed in a segmented 'tiger's tail' pattern. This implies that developing retinal arteries contain different types of endothelial cells, Dll4-positive and Dll4-negative. The Dll4-positive stripes do not correspond to any obvious morphological property of the vascular network but correlate to some extent with the distribution of platelet derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) mRNA. However, PDGF-B expression is neither as artery-specific nor as clearly segmented as Dll4. Possible target cells for Dll4 signalling are retinal astrocytes (Notch1 positive), arterial pericytes (Notch3 positive) or arterial endothelial cells themselves (Notch4 positive).

Three weeks after vector delivery, EAU was induced with a subcutaneous injection of a mixture of interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) peptide with CFA. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Retinal function was evaluated with electroretinography (ERG). We found that the expression of MIF and its two receptors CD74 and CD44 was increased in the EAU mouse retina. Compared to AAV8.CBA.eGFP-injected and untreated EAU mice, the level of proinflammatory cytokines, the expression of Notch1, Notch4, delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), Notch receptor intracellular domain (NICD) and hairy enhancer of split-1 (Hes-1) increased, but the ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes decreased in AAV8.CBA.MIF-injected EAU mice. The Notch inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) reduced the expression of NICD, Hes-1 and proinflammatory cytokines. Further, a MIF antagonist ISO-1 attenuated intraocular inflammation, and inhibited the differentiation of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 in EAU mice. We demonstrated that over-expression of MIF exaggerated ocular inflammation, which was associated with the activation of the Notch signalling. The expression of both MIF and its receptors are elevated in EAU mice. Over-expression of MIF exaggerates ocular inflammation, and this exaggerated inflammation is associated with the activation of the Notch signalling and Notch pathway.

The NOTCH4 extracellular domain also inhibits NOTCH1 signalling when expressed in cis, raising the possibility that reported Notch4 phenotypes may not be due to loss of NOTCH4 function.

However, studies in chick and mouse have shown that both Eph receptors and ephrins are also expressed within the retina itself, raising the possibility that this receptor-ligand family mediates aspects of retinal development. Here, we more fully document the presence of specific EphB receptors and B-ephrins in embryonic mouse retina and provide evidence that EphB receptors are involved in RGC axon pathfinding to the optic disc. We find that as RGC axons begin this pathfinding process, EphB receptors are uniformly expressed along the dorsal-ventral retinal axis. This is in contrast to the previously reported high ventral-low dorsal gradient of EphB receptors later in development when RGC axons map to CNS targets. We show that mice lacking both EphB2 and EphB3 receptor tyrosine kinases, but not each alone, exhibit increased frequency of RGC axon guidance errors to the optic disc. In these animals, major aspects of retinal development and cellular organization appear normal, as do the expression of other RGC guidance cues netrin, DCC, and L1. Unexpectedly, errors occur in dorsal but not ventral retina despite early uniform or later high ventral expression of EphB2 and EphB3. Furthermore, embryos lacking EphB3 and the kinase domain of EphB2 do not show increased errors, consistent with a guidance role for the EphB2 extracellular domain.

Many mRNA transcripts are known to reside in developing axons, yet little is known about their subcellular distribution or, specifically, which transcripts are in growth cones. Here laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to isolate the growth cones of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons of two vertebrate species, mouse and Xenopus, coupled with unbiased genomewide microarray profiling. An unexpectedly large pool of mRNAs defined predominant pathways in protein synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, cancer, neurological disease, and signaling. Comparative profiling of \"young\" (pathfinding) versus \"old\" (target-arriving) Xenopus growth cones revealed that the number and complexity of transcripts increases dramatically with age. Many presynaptic protein mRNAs are present exclusively in old growth cones, suggesting that functionally related sets of mRNAs are targeted to growth cones in a developmentally regulated way. Remarkably, a subset of mRNAs was significantly enriched in the growth cone compared with the axon compartment, indicating that mechanisms exist to localize mRNAs selectively to the growth cone. Furthermore, some receptor transcripts (e.g., EphB4), present exclusively in old growth cones, were equally abundant in young and old cell bodies, indicating that RNA trafficking from the soma is developmentally regulated. Our findings show that the mRNA repertoire in growth cones is regulated dynamically with age and suggest that mRNA localization is tailored to match the functional demands of the growing axon tip as it transforms into the presynaptic terminal.", "score": 1, "id": "21084603", "title": "Subcellular profiling reveals distinct and developmentally regulated repertoire of growth cone mRNAs."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>To investigate whether EphrinB2 (EfnB2) or EphB4 influence retinal angiogenesis under physiological or pathological conditions.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Using the mouse model of oxygen-induced proliferative retinopathy (OIR), the expression of EfnB2, EphB4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and localized in EfnB2- and EphB4-lacZ mice.

Here, we more fully document the presence of specific EphB receptors and B-ephrins in embryonic mouse retina and provide evidence that EphB receptors are involved in RGC axon pathfinding to the optic disc.

We show that mice lacking both EphB2 and EphB3 receptor tyrosine kinases, but not each alone, exhibit increased frequency of RGC axon guidance errors to the optic disc. In these animals, major aspects of retinal development and cellular organization appear normal, as do the expression of other RGC guidance cues netrin, DCC, and L1.

The RP1 gene is specifically expressed in the photoreceptor layers of the postnatal retina and encodes a predicted protein characterised by the presence of two doublecortin (DC) domains, known to be implicated in microtubule binding. We identified and characterised, both in human and in mouse, a novel mammalian gene, termed Retinitis Pigmentosa1-like1 (RP1L1), because of its significant sequence similarity to the RP1 gene product. The sequence homology between RP1 and RP1L1 was found to be mostly restricted to the DC domains and to the N-terminal region, including the first 350 amino acids.
