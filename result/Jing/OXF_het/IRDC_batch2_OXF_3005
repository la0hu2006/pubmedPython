In the past few years, many algorithms have been developed for the automated detection of a specific pathology, typically diabetic retinopathy, using eye fundus photography. No matter how good these algorithms are, we believe many clinicians would not use automatic detection tools focusing on a single pathology and ignoring any other pathology present in the patient's retinas. To solve this issue, an algorithm for characterizing the appearance of abnormal retinas, as well as the appearance of the normal ones, is presented. This algorithm does not focus on individual images: it considers examination records consisting of multiple photographs of each retina, together with contextual information about the patient. Specifically, it relies on data mining in order to learn diagnosis rules from characterizations of fundus examination records. The main novelty is that the content of examination records (images and context) is characterized at multiple levels of spatial and lexical granularity: 1) spatial flexibility is ensured by an adaptive decomposition of composite retinal images into a cascade of regions, 2) lexical granularity is ensured by an adaptive decomposition of the feature space into a cascade of visual words. This multigranular representation allows for great flexibility in automatically characterizing normality and abnormality: it is possible to generate diagnosis rules whose precision and generalization ability can be traded off depending on data availability. A variation on usual data mining algorithms, originally designed to mine static data, is proposed so that contextual and visual data at adaptive granularity levels can be mined. This framework was evaluated in e-ophtha, a dataset of 25,702 examination records from the OPHDIAT screening network, as well as in the publicly-available Messidor dataset.

This vertical eye movement component is necessary to prevent retinal slip. We asked whether fixation on a near head-fixed target during the same torsional vestibular stimulation would lead to differences of vertical eye movements between the right and the left eye, as the directions of the two lines-of-sight are not parallel during convergence. Healthy human subjects (n = 6) were oscillated (0.3 Hz, +/-30 degrees) about the nasooccipital axis on a three-dimensional motor-driven turntable. Binocular movements were recorded using the dual search coil technique. A head-fixed laser dot was presented 1.4 m (far head-fixed target) or 0.25 m (near head-fixed target) in front of the right eye. We found highly significant (P < 0.01) correlations (R binocular = 0.8, monocular = 0.59) between the convergence angle and the difference of the vertical eye velocity between the two eyes. The slope of the fitted linear regression between the two parameters (s = 0.45) was close to the theoretical slope necessary to prevent vertical retinal slippage (predicted s = 0.5). Covering the left eye did not significantly change the slope (s = 0.52). In addition, there was a marked gain reduction (approximately 35%) of the torsional vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) between viewing the far and the near targets, confirming earlier results by others. There was no difference in torsional gain reduction between the two eyes. Lenses of +3 dpt positioned in front of both eyes to decrease the amount of accommodation did not further change the gain of the torsional VOR. In conclusion, ocular convergence on a near head-fixed target during torsional vestibular stimulation leads to deviations in vertical angular velocity between the two eyes necessary to prevent vertical double vision. The vertical deviation velocity is mainly linked to the amount of convergence, since it also occurs during monocular viewing of the near head-fixed target.

The following conclusions have been drawn. As long as myopia progression is visually controlled, at least three different interventions are possible: (i) spectacles/contact lenses which correct only the centre of the visual field and leave the periphery somewhat myopic, (ii) outdoor activity or equivalent temporary increase in illuminance, (iii) pharmacological intervention of retinal growth signals that are transmitted to the underlying sclera. Options (i) and (ii) can be used without risks although there is still room for improvement of the variables. Option (iii) has re-entered a new phase of orientation with new searches for candidate targets after previous testing with muskarinic antagonists (pirenzepine) in children did not enter phase 3 level. If myopia is outside the range over which it is visually controlled by emmetropisation (in the case of high and pathological myopias), in principle the possibility exists to improve the mechanical stability of the sclera pharmacologically. However, there is still a need for more research. Up to now, the mechanical weakness of the sclera in highly mopyic eyes is surgically stabilised by \"scleral buckling\". However, these procedures have found limited acceptance since the effects were not very reliable. In 40 - 50 % of the cases of high myopia, degenerative processes are found in the retina which can be seen as consequence of the mechanical tension in the fundus, but may also be indepedent of this factor (no significant correlation with axial length!).

In the past few years, many algorithms have been developed for the automated detection of a specific pathology, typically diabetic retinopathy, using eye fundus photography. No matter how good these algorithms are, we believe many clinicians would not use automatic detection tools focusing on a single pathology and ignoring any other pathology present in the patient's retinas. To solve this issue, an algorithm for characterizing the appearance of abnormal retinas, as well as the appearance of the normal ones, is presented. This algorithm does not focus on individual images: it considers examination records consisting of multiple photographs of each retina, together with contextual information about the patient. Specifically, it relies on data mining in order to learn diagnosis rules from characterizations of fundus examination records. The main novelty is that the content of examination records (images and context) is characterized at multiple levels of spatial and lexical granularity: 1) spatial flexibility is ensured by an adaptive decomposition of composite retinal images into a cascade of regions, 2) lexical granularity is ensured by an adaptive decomposition of the feature space into a cascade of visual words. This multigranular representation allows for great flexibility in automatically characterizing normality and abnormality: it is possible to generate diagnosis rules whose precision and generalization ability can be traded off depending on data availability. A variation on usual data mining algorithms, originally designed to mine static data, is proposed so that contextual and visual data at adaptive granularity levels can be mined. This framework was evaluated in e-ophtha, a dataset of 25,702 examination records from the OPHDIAT screening network, as well as in the publicly-available Messidor dataset.

This vertical eye movement component is necessary to prevent retinal slip. We asked whether fixation on a near head-fixed target during the same torsional vestibular stimulation would lead to differences of vertical eye movements between the right and the left eye, as the directions of the two lines-of-sight are not parallel during convergence. Healthy human subjects (n = 6) were oscillated (0.3 Hz, +/-30 degrees) about the nasooccipital axis on a three-dimensional motor-driven turntable. Binocular movements were recorded using the dual search coil technique. A head-fixed laser dot was presented 1.4 m (far head-fixed target) or 0.25 m (near head-fixed target) in front of the right eye. We found highly significant (P < 0.01) correlations (R binocular = 0.8, monocular = 0.59) between the convergence angle and the difference of the vertical eye velocity between the two eyes. The slope of the fitted linear regression between the two parameters (s = 0.45) was close to the theoretical slope necessary to prevent vertical retinal slippage (predicted s = 0.5). Covering the left eye did not significantly change the slope (s = 0.52). In addition, there was a marked gain reduction (approximately 35%) of the torsional vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) between viewing the far and the near targets, confirming earlier results by others. There was no difference in torsional gain reduction between the two eyes. Lenses of +3 dpt positioned in front of both eyes to decrease the amount of accommodation did not further change the gain of the torsional VOR. In conclusion, ocular convergence on a near head-fixed target during torsional vestibular stimulation leads to deviations in vertical angular velocity between the two eyes necessary to prevent vertical double vision. The vertical deviation velocity is mainly linked to the amount of convergence, since it also occurs during monocular viewing of the near head-fixed target.

In order to retrieve semantically-relevant videos, most existing CBVR systems rely on temporally flexible distance measures such as Dynamic Time Warping. These distance measures are slow and therefore do not allow real-time retrieval. In the proposed system, temporal flexibility is introduced in the way video subsequences are characterized, which allows the use of simple and fast distance measures. As a consequence, realtime retrieval of similar video subsequences, among hundreds of thousands of examples, is now possible. Besides, the proposed system is adaptive: a fast training procedure is presented. The system has been successfully applied to automated recognition of retinal surgery steps on a 69-video dataset: areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves range from A(z)=0.809 to A(z)=0.989.", "score": 2, "id": "22255330", "title": "Real-time retrieval of similar videos with application to computer-aided retinal surgery."}, {"abstract": "This review summarises some recent aspects of myopia research. The following conclusions have been drawn. As long as myopia progression is visually controlled, at least three different interventions are possible: (i) spectacles/contact lenses which correct only the centre of the visual field and leave the periphery somewhat myopic, (ii) outdoor activity or equivalent temporary increase in illuminance, (iii) pharmacological intervention of retinal growth signals that are transmitted to the underlying sclera. Options (i) and (ii) can be used without risks although there is still room for improvement of the variables. Option (iii) has re-entered a new phase of orientation with new searches for candidate targets after previous testing with muskarinic antagonists (pirenzepine) in children did not enter phase 3 level. If myopia is outside the range over which it is visually controlled by emmetropisation (in the case of high and pathological myopias), in principle the possibility exists to improve the mechanical stability of the sclera pharmacologically. However, there is still a need for more research. Up to now, the mechanical weakness of the sclera in highly mopyic eyes is surgically stabilised by \"scleral buckling\". However, these procedures have found limited acceptance since the effects were not very reliable. In 40 - 50 % of the cases of high myopia, degenerative processes are found in the retina which can be seen as consequence of the mechanical tension in the fundus, but may also be indepedent of this factor (no significant correlation with axial length!). In part they can be slowed down by intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.

PDZD7, a paralog of two USH causative genes, USH1C and USH2D (WHRN), was recently reported to be implicated in USH2 and non-syndromic deafness. It encodes a protein with multiple PDZ domains. To understand the biological function of PDZD7 and the pathogenic mechanism caused by PDZD7 mutations, we generated and thoroughly characterized a Pdzd7 knockout mouse model. The Pdzd7 knockout mice exhibit congenital profound deafness, as assessed by auditory brainstem response, distortion product otoacoustic emission and cochlear microphonics tests, and normal vestibular function, as assessed by their behaviors. Lack of PDZD7 leads to the disorganization of stereocilia bundles and a reduction in mechanotransduction currents and sensitivity in cochlear outer hair cells. At the molecular level, PDZD7 determines the localization of the USH2 protein complex, composed of USH2A, GPR98 and WHRN, to ankle links in developing cochlear hair cells, likely through its direct interactions with these three proteins. The localization of PDZD7 to the ankle links of cochlear hair bundles also relies on USH2 proteins. In photoreceptors of Pdzd7 knockout mice, the three USH2 proteins largely remain unchanged at the periciliary membrane complex. The electroretinogram responses of both rod and cone photoreceptors are normal in knockout mice at 1 month of age. Therefore, although the organization of the USH2 complex appears different in photoreceptors, it is clear that PDZD7 plays an essential role in organizing the USH2 complex at ankle links in developing cochlear hair cells.

In 11 atypical families, none of whom had any previously identified convincing disease-causing mutations, the mutation USH2A: c.7595-2144A>G was identified in a heterozygous state in one family. All five deletions and the heterozygous duplication we report here are novel.

The aim of this work was to determine the contribution of GPR98 and DFNB31 genes in a Spanish cohort of USH2A negative patients using exhaustive molecular analysis, including sequencing, dosage, and splicing analysis.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Linkage analysis was performed to prioritize the gene to study, followed by sequencing of exons and intron-exon boundaries of the selected gene, GPR98 (90 exons) or DFNB31 (12 exons). Functional splicing analyses and comparative genomic hybridization array to detect large rearrangements were performed when appropriate.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>We confirmed that mutations in GPR98 contribute a significant but minor role to Usher syndrome type 2. In a group of patients referred for molecular diagnosis, 43 had been found to be positive for USH2A mutations, the remaining 19 without USH2A alterations were screened, and seven different mutations were identified in the GPR98 gene in seven patients (five in the homozygous state), of which six were novel. All detected mutations result in a truncated protein; deleterious missense mutations were not found. No pathological mutations were identified in the DFNB31 gene.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>In Spain, USH2A and GPR98 are responsible for 95.8% and 5.2% of USH2 mutated cases, respectively.

We could show that it was the event of proximity of retinal vessel and RPE that triggered migration of RPE cells along the contacting vessels towards the inner retina. Ultrastructurally, these mislocalized RPE cells partially sealed the vessels by tight junction linkage and deposited extracellular matrix perivascularly.

In a long-term study we observed, with light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry and electroretinographic recordings, two overlapping events in the Bassoon mutant retina, i.e. loss of photoreceptor synapses in the outer plexiform layer, and structural remodeling and formation of ectopic photoreceptor synapses in the outer nuclear layer, a region usually devoid of synapses. Formation of ectopic synaptic sites starts around the time when photoreceptor synaptogenesis is completed in wild-type mice and progresses throughout life. The result is a dense plexus of ectopic photoreceptor synapses with significantly altered but considerable synaptic transmission. Ectopic synapse formation is led by the sprouting of horizontal cells followed by the extension of rod bipolar cell neurites that fasciculate with and grow along the horizontal cell processes.

Although it is extensively used in retinal degeneration and repair studies, how photoreceptor degeneration affects retinal circuitry has not been fully explored. This study examined the changes in synaptic connectivity between photoreceptors and their target cells using immunocytochemistry and correlated these changes with retinal function using the electroretinogram (ERG). Immunostaining with bassoon and synaptophysin (as presynaptic markers) and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR6, a postsynaptic marker for ON-bipolar dendrites) was already impaired at postnatal day (P) 21 and progressively lost with infrequent pairing of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements at P60. By P90 to P120, staining became increasingly patchy and was eventually restricted to sparsely and irregularly distributed foci in which the normal pairing of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers was lost. ERG results showed that mixed scotopic a-waves and b-waves were already reduced by P21 but not oscillatory potentials. While cone-driven responses (photopic b-wave) reached normal levels at P30, they were impaired by P60 but could still be recorded at P120, although with reduced amplitude; rod responses never reached normal amplitudes. Thus, only cone-driven activity attained normal levels, but declined rapidly thereafter. In conclusion, the synaptic markers associated with photoreceptors and processes of bipolar and horizontal cells show abnormalities prior to significant photoreceptor loss.

The cone pathway is relatively unaffected. By 150 days, when rods are absent from much of the retina, some rod bipolars remain and dendrites of rod and cone bipolar cells form synaptic complexes associated with cones and horizontal cell processes. These complexes include foci of mGluR6 and bassoon staining; they develop further by 270 days of age. Over the course of degeneration, beginning at 21 days, bipolar axon terminals atrophy and the inner retina undergoes further changes including a reduced and disorganized AII amacrine cell population and thinning of the inner plexiform layer. Electroretinogram (ERG) results at 23 days show reductions in a-wave amplitude, in rod and cone-associated b-waves (using a double flash paradigm) and in the amplitude of oscillatory potentials (OPs). By 38 days, rod scotopic a-wave responses and OPs are lost. B-wave amplitudes decline until 150 days, at which point they are purely cone-driven and remain stable up to 250 days.

The results were compared to scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of BSP degeneration in human RP.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>After the loss of all photoreceptor cells in rho-/- mice, the outer retina successively degenerated, leading to approximation and finally a direct contact of inner retinal vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We could show that it was the event of proximity of retinal vessel and RPE that triggered migration of RPE cells along the contacting vessels towards the inner retina. Ultrastructurally, these mislocalized RPE cells partially sealed the vessels by tight junction linkage and deposited extracellular matrix perivascularly. Also, the vascular endothelium developed fenestrations similar to the RPE-choroid interface. In whole mounts, the pigmented cell clusters outlining retinal capillaries correlated well with BSPs in human RP.

Immunostaining with bassoon and synaptophysin (as presynaptic markers) and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR6, a postsynaptic marker for ON-bipolar dendrites) was already impaired at postnatal day (P) 21 and progressively lost with infrequent pairing of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements at P60.

ERG results showed that mixed scotopic a-waves and b-waves were already reduced by P21 but not oscillatory potentials. While cone-driven responses (photopic b-wave) reached normal levels at P30, they were impaired by P60 but could still be recorded at P120, although with reduced amplitude; rod responses never reached normal amplitudes. Thus, only cone-driven activity attained normal levels, but declined rapidly thereafter.

Other proteins, such as Veli3 and PSD-95, also display abnormal expression in rods prior to eye opening. Conversely, vesicle related proteins appear normal. Our data demonstrate that the Ca(V)1.4 channel is important for maintaining scaffolding proteins in the ribbon synapse but less vital for proteins related to vesicular release. This study also confirms that in adult retinae, cones show developmental features such as sprouting and synaptogenesis. Overall we present evidence that in the absence of the Ca(V)1.4 channel, photoreceptor synapses remain immature and are unable to stabilize.", "score": 1, "id": "23675510", "title": "Calcium channel-dependent molecular maturation of photoreceptor synapses."}, {"abstract": "Ribbon synapses are tonically active high-throughput synapses. The performance of the ribbon synapse is accomplished by a specialization of the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) referred to as the synaptic ribbon (SR). Progress in our understanding of the structure-function relationship at the ribbon synapse has come from observations that, in photoreceptors lacking a full-size scaffolding protein Bassoon (Bsn(\u0394Ex4/5)), dissociation of SRs coincides with perturbed signal transfer. The aim of the present study has been to elaborate the role of Bassoon as a structural organizer of the ribbon synapse and to differentiate it with regard to the ambient lighting conditions. The ultrastructure of retinal ribbon synapses has been compared between wild-type (Wt) and Bsn(\u0394Ex4/5) mice adapted to light (low activity) and darkness (high activity). The results obtained suggest that Bassoon and environmental illumination synergistically and complementarily act as organizers of the ribbon synapse. Thus, light-dependent and Bassoon-independent regulation involves initial SR tethering to the membrane and a basic shape transition of ribbon material from spherical to rod-like, since darkness induces these features in Bsn(\u0394Ex4/5) rod spherules. However, the tight anchorage of the SR via an arciform density and the proper assembly of SRs to the full-sized horseshoe-shaped complex depend on Bassoon, as these steps fail in Bsn(\u0394Ex4/5) rod spherules.", "score": 1, "id": "23295987", "title": "Evidence for synergistic and complementary roles of Bassoon and darkness in organizing the ribbon synapse."}, {"abstract": "Photoreceptor cells encode light signals over a wide range of intensities with graded changes in their membrane potential. At their highly specialized ribbon synapses they transmit the signals to the postsynaptic neurons by the tonic release of glutamate, which is continuously adjusted to changes in light intensity. Such a level of performance requires adaptive mechanisms, and it is suggested that illumination-dependent changes in ribbon shape and size are one of these adaptive processes. In this study we compared structural properties of synaptic ribbons under various illumination conditions between three mouse strains: the pigmented C57BL/6 and the two albino strains Balb/c and B6(Cg)-Tyr(c-2J) /J (coisogenic to C57BL/6). In addition, electroretinograms (ERGs) recorded in the same groups were compared. In the C57BL/6 mouse a change in illumination did not result in structural alterations of the synaptic ribbon. Similarly, in the B6(Cg)-Tyr(c-2J) /J mouse only minor structural changes were detected. In contrast, the state of adaptation had a large influence on the ribbon structure of the Balb/c mouse. The ERG recordings showed only small functional differences between C57BL/6 and B6(Cg)-Tyr(c-2J) /J mice, but the retinal function of Balb/c mice was strongly compromised. We conclude that illumination-dependent changes of photoreceptor ribbon structure differ between strains and thus cannot be regarded as a general mechanism for light adaptation.", "score": 1, "id": "22678522", "title": "Strain differences in illumination-dependent structural changes at mouse photoreceptor ribbon synapses."}, {"abstract": "The members of the Liprin-\u03b1 protein family, Liprin-\u03b11-4, are scaffolding proteins that play important roles in the regulation of synapse assembly and maturation, vesicular trafficking, and cell motility. Recent evidence suggests that despite their high degree of homology, the four isoforms can be differentially regulated and fulfill diverging functions. However, to date their precise regional and subcellular distribution has remained elusive. Here, we examine the spatiotemporal expression patterns of Liprins-\u03b1 in the rodent by using in situ hybridization, immunoblotting, and immunochemistry of primary cells as well as brain and retina sections. We show that Liprin-\u03b11-4 mRNA and protein are widely expressed throughout the developing and adult central nervous system, with Liprin-\u03b12 and -\u03b13 being the major Liprin-\u03b1 isoforms in the brain. Our data show that the four Liprin-\u03b1 proteins differ in their regional distribution, in particular in the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb. Liprin-\u03b11 exhibits a unique spatiotemporal expression pattern as its levels decrease during synaptogenesis, and it is the only Liprin-\u03b1 with substantial non-neuronal expression. Immunocytochemistry of cultured primary neurons with pre- and postsynaptic marker proteins shows all four Liprins-\u03b1 to be present at synapses and nonsynaptic sites to varying degrees.

Recently we showed that photoreceptor ribbon complexes are assembled from non-membranous, spherical densities--the precursor spheres--during the first two postnatal weeks of photoreceptor synaptogenesis. A core component of the precursor spheres and a key player in attaching the ribbon to the active zone is the presynaptic cytomatrix protein Bassoon. In this study, we examined in a comprehensive light and electron microscopic analysis whether Bassoon plays a role in the formation of the precursor spheres using Bassoon mutant mice lacking functional Bassoon. We report that developing Bassoon mutant photoreceptors contain fewer and smaller precursor spheres and that transport of precursor spheres to nascent synapses is delayed compared to wild-type controls. Moreover, western blot analyses of homogenates from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P14 Bassoon mutant retinae exhibit lower RIBEYE and Piccolo protein levels compared to the wild type, indicating elevated protein degradation in the absence of Bassoon.

Following from a previous study showing that the SCN undergoes day/night rearrangements of its neuronal-glial network that may be crucial for intercellular phasing, we investigated the contribution of glutamatergic synapses, known to play major roles in SCN functioning, to such rhythmic plastic events. Neither expression levels of the vesicular glutamate transporters nor numbers of glutamatergic terminals showed nycthemeral variations in the SCN. However, using quantitative imaging after combined immunolabelling, the density of synapses on neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide, known as targets of the retinal input, increased during the day and both glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic synapses contributed to the increase (+36%). This was not the case for synapses made on vasopressin-containing neurons, the other major source of SCN efferents in the non-retinorecipient region. Together with electron microscope observations showing no differences in the morphometric features of glutamatergic terminals during the day and night, these data show that the light synchronization process in the SCN involves a selective remodelling of synapses at sites of photic integration.
