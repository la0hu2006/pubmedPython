Six animals from each group were killed immediately after hyperoxia (or room air) and the remainder exposed to room air for 5 days. Retinal mRNA expression of VEGF(121), VEGF(165), VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1, or Flt-1), and VEGFR-2 (or KDR/Flk-1) was determined.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Hyperoxia resulted in increased retinal expression of mRNA of the VEGF splice variants in the groups treated with Sal, Dex, and Veh, whereas a decrease in VEGF(121) was noted in the Cel-treated group. In contrast, retinal Flt-1 receptor mRNA was markedly increased in the Cel-treated group only, whereas retinal VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1) receptor mRNA was suppressed in all the treatment groups.

These cells have a relatively large, elongated soma and straight, sparsely branching dendrites, stratified in the vitreal half of the inner plexiform layer. The main axon (0.6 microns average diameter) passes along the optic fibre bundles, disappearing into the optic disk, whilst its collaterals run mainly in the inner plexiform layer. A cell showing similar morphology has also been found in the ganglion cell layer of a cat retina. The second population of processes consists of very thick fibres (2.1 microns average diameter) apparently originating from the optic disk. The main branches run in the space between the optic fibre layer and the ganglion cell layer, with short, secondary processes crossing the ganglion cel layer orthogonally. Many higher-order processes originate from the second-order branches; these run almost horizontally in the inner plexiform layer.

In the eyes of elderly patients, these adducts have been observed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), particularly within the underlying pentalaminar substrate known as Bruch's membrane. AGEs have also been localized to age-related subcellular deposits (drusen and basal laminar deposits) and are thought to play a pathogenic role in progression of the major sight-threatening condition known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The current study has quantified AGEs in Bruch's membrane from postmortem eyes and established age-related correlations. In particular, we investigated the potential of confocal Raman microscopy to identify and quantify AGEs in Bruch's membrane in a nondestructive, analytical fashion. Bruch's membrane and the innermost layers of the underlying choroid (BM-Ch) were dissected from fresh postmortem eye-cups (n=56). AGE adducts were quantified from homogenized tissue using reverse-phase HPLC and GC/MS in combination with immunohistochemistry. For parallel Raman analysis, BM-Ch was flat-mounted on slides and evaluated using a Raman confocal microscope and spectra analyzed by a range of statistical approaches. Quantitative analysis showed that the AGEs pentosidine, carboxymethyllysine (CML), and carboxyethyllysine (CEL) occurred at significantly higher levels in BM-Ch with age (P<0.05-0.01). Defined Raman spectral \"fingerprints\" were identified for various AGEs and these were observed in the clinical samples using confocal Raman microscopy. The Raman data set successfully modeled AGEs and not only provided quantitative data that compared with conventional analytical approaches, but also provided new and complementary information via a nondestructive approach with high spatial resolution.
