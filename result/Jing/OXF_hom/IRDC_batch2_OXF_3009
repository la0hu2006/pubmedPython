ratio for glutamatergic neurotransmission and to protect neurons from excitotoxic damage. The mammalian retina is known to express the excitatory amino acid transporters, EAAT1-5; however, their specific role in glutamate homeostasis is poorly understood. To examine the role of the glial glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) in the retina, we have studied glutamate transport by Muller cells in GLAST-/- mice, using biochemical, electrophysiological, and immunocytochemical techniques. Glutamate uptake assays indicated that the Km value for glutamate uptake was similar in wild-type and GLAST-/- mouse retinas, but the Vmax was approximately 50% lower in the mutant. In Na+-free medium, the Vmax was further reduced by 40%. In patch-clamp recordings of dissociated Muller cells from GLAST-/- mice, application of 0.1 mM glutamate evoked no current showing that the cells lacked functional electrogenic glutamate transporters. The result also indicated that there was no compensatory upregulation of EAATs in Muller cells. [3H]D-Aspartate uptake autoradiography, however, showed that Na+-dependent, high-affinity transporters account for most of the glutamate uptake by Muller cells, and that Na+-independent glutamate transport is negligible. Additional experiments showed that the residual glutamate uptake in Muller cells in the GLAST-/- mouse retina is not due to known glutamate transporters-cystine-glutamate exchanger, ASCT-1, AGT-1, or other heteroexchangers. The present study shows that while several known glutamate transporters are expressed by mammalian Muller cells, new Na+-dependent, high-affinity glutamate transporters remain to be identified.", "score": 4, "id": "15390100", "title": "Glutamate transport by retinal Muller cells in glutamate/aspartate transporter-knockout mice."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>To report the linkage analysis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in an Indian family.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Individuals were examined for symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa and their blood samples were withdrawn for genetic analysis.

The purpose of this study was to test the expression and distribution of this gene and its protein in rat and in mouse tissues, in light-stressed rat retinas and in the retinas of NeuroD1 knock-out mice to understand the role of CERKL in the retina. Expression of Cerkl and Cerk mRNA was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of the protein was determined by Western blotting with anti-CERKL antibody. Localization of the protein was determined by using immunofluorescence microscopy. With qRT-PCR, we revealed that the relative mRNA expression of Cerkl was the highest in the retina among all the rat tissue tested; it was >10-fold higher than in the brain. On the other hand, Cerk has ubiquitous expression and its relative abundance is >2 fold of Cerkl in the retina. Cerkl was expressed minimally in the developing mouse eyes and reached a peak at retinal maturity at 2 months. Western blots of retinal tissues revealed two major CERKL protein bands: 59\u00a0kDa (C1) and 37\u00a0kDa (C2). However, only C2 CERKL was found in the rat retinal rod outer segment (ROS) at level of that was not changed in light vs. dark adaptation. In the light-stressed retina, expression of Cerkl mRNA increased significantly, which was reflected in only on C2 CERKL protein. The CERKL protein localized prominently to the ganglion cells, inner nuclear layers (INL), retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and photoreceptor inner segments in the retinal sections. Nuclear localization of CERKL was not affected in RPE, INL and the ganglion cell layers in the light-stressed retina; however, the perinuclear and outer segment locations appear to be altered. In the NeuroD1 knock-out mouse retina, the expression of Cerkl mRNA and protein decreased and that decrease also pertains to C2 CERKL. In conclusion, the retina had the highest level of Cerkl mRNA and protein expression, which reached its maximum in the adult retina; CERKL localized to ROS and RPE cells and the light-adaptation did not change the level of CERKL in ROS; light-stress induced Cerkl expression in the retina; and its expression decreased in NeuroD1 knock-out retina.

A total of seven different Cerkl splice-isoforms were identified in the mouse retina. The subcellular localization of CERKL in retina-derived cell lines is variable: CERKL is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, and in many cells, it is highly concentrated in the perinuclear region. In most, but not all cells, CERKL is also highly concentrated in the nucleus. In the mouse retina, CERKL is located in the ganglion cell layer, in amacrine cells of the inner nuclear layer, and in photoreceptors. CERKL is highly expressed in cone photoreceptors; however, its expression level in rod photoreceptors is very low. In cultured cells, CERKL is detected in the nucleus, but in retinal cells in situ, it is mostly located in the cytoplasm.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The expression of Cerkl in both mature and embryonic mouse retina and the severe retinal phenotype associated with human CERKL mutations indicate that this gene plays a crucial role in retinal activity, and that it may be important for retinal development as well.

Our results showed a consistent and notable decrease of the retinal SPL content (mainly ranging from 30% to 60%) in the Cerkl\u00a0-/- compared to WT retinas, which was particularly evident in the glucosyl/galactosyl ceramide species (Glc/GalCer) whereas the phospholipids and neutral lipids remained unaltered.

Fourteen of the 16 mutant alleles identified were previously unknown. Among these, there was a 2.3-kb deletion in USH2A and an inverted duplication of ~446 kb in EYS, which would have likely escaped conventional screening techniques or exome sequencing. Moreover, in another Japanese patient, we identified a homozygous frameshift (p.L206fs), absent in more than 2,500 chromosomes from ethnically matched controls, in the ciliary gene NEK2, encoding a serine/threonine-protein kinase. Inactivation of this gene in zebrafish induced retinal photoreceptor defects that were rescued by human NEK2 mRNA.

"<b>BACKGROUND: </b>The ABCC5 gene encodes an organic anion pump of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, subclass C. The exact physiological function of ABCC5 however is not known. Here, we have isolated three novel ABCC5 splice variants and characterized their role in the regulation of ABCC5 gene expression.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Two additional exons within intron 5 of the ABCC5 gene were identified; one of the exons exhibits alternative donor splice sites. Differential usage of these exons generates three short ABCC5 transcripts named ABCC5_SV1, ABCC5_SV2 and ABCC5_SV3. The variants share the first five exons with the ABCC5 gene but differ in their 3' sequences. ABCC5 and its novel isoforms are abundantly expressed in the human retina. Splice variant ABCC5_SV1 and ABCC5_SV2 contain premature stop codons. While inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay selectively stabilized ABCC5_SV1 but not ABCC5_SV2, the amount of full length ABCC5 mRNA was simultaneously reduced. A negative regulatory effect on full length ABCC5 expression was also observed when the ABCC5 isoforms were silenced with siRNA duplexes. Finally, we show that the evolutionarily conserved ABCC5_SV2 transcript is translated into a protein abundantly present in endothelial cells of inner retinal blood vessels and along RPE membranes.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>Our data suggest that alternative splicing of the ABCC5 gene has functional consequences by modulating ABCC5 gene expression. In addition, at least one ABCC5 splice variant is protein-coding and produces a truncated ABCC5 protein isoform with thus far unknown functional properties in the retina.<br/>", "score": 4, "id": "17521428", "title": "Three novel ABCC5 splice variants in human retina and their role as regulators of ABCC5 gene expression."}, {"abstract": "We investigated the effects of age-related changes within the Bruch membrane on the gene expression profile of the RPE. Immortalized human ARPE-19 cells were seeded onto acellular human Bruch membrane from younger and older donors and harvested 72 hr later; total RNA was isolated and the gene expression profile was determined using the Affymetrix Human Genome U95A gene chip. Twelve genes were upregulated and 8 genes were downregulated with Bruch membrane aging; RT-PCR confirms that Bruch membrane aging upregulates genes in RPE cells encoding for transforming growth factor alpha and downregulates genes for vitronectin and the membrane transporter ABCC5. The role of these changes in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases such as macular degeneration remains to be elucidated.", "score": 2, "id": "16500769", "title": "Bruch membrane aging alters the

immunocytochemical localization of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in rat retinal cells. Using biochemical and immunochemical methods we have identified microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) as major MAPs in the rat retina. With indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, the inner plexiform layer and the ganglion cell layer were stained with both anti-MAP1A antibody and anti-MAP2 antibody. Cells at the inner margin of the inner nuclear layer were prominently stained with anti-MAP2, but not with anti-MAP1A. Thin section-immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibodies revealed MAP1A and MAP2 staining in the neuronal processes of the inner plexiform layer. A filamentous network between the microtubules in the neurites was stained with both antibodies. The developmental course of expression of MAP1A and MAP2 in rat retina was studied by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Although MAP2 was already present at 1 day postnatal, MAP1A was not detected until 7 days postnatal. These results indicate that: (1) retinal neurons are heterogeneous in their expression of MAPs; (2) retinal ganglion cells show the same intracellular distribution of MAP1A and MAP2 as typical nerve cells such as motor neurons; and (3) MAP1A and MAP2 are differentially expressed in developing rat retina.", "score": 7, "id": "2706525", "title": "Immunocytochemical localization of microtubule-associated proteins 1A and 2 in the rat retina."}, {"abstract": "Tubby-like protein-1 (Tulp1) is a photoreceptor-specific protein involved in the transport of specific proteins from the inner segment (IS) to the outer segment (OS) in photoreceptor cells. Mutations in the human TULP1 gene cause an early onset form of retinitis pigmentosa. Our previous work has shown an association between Tulp1 and the microtubule-associated protein, MAP1B. An allele of Mtap1a, which encodes the MAP1A protein, significantly delays photoreceptor degeneration in Tulp1 mutant mice. MAP1 proteins are important in stabilizing microtubules in neuronal cells, but their role in photoreceptors remains obscure. To investigate the relationship between Tulp1 and MAP1 proteins, we performed western blots, immunoprecipitations (IP), immunohistochemistry and proximity ligand assays (PLA) in wild-type and tulp1-/- mouse retinas. Our IP experiments provide evidence that Tulp1 and MAP1B interact while PLA experiments localize their interaction to the outer nuclear layer and IS of photoreceptors. Although MAP1A and MAP1B protein levels are not affected in the tulp1-/- retina, they are no longer localized to the OS of photoreceptors. This may be the cause for disorganized OSs in tulp1-/- mice, and indicate that their transport to the OS is Tulp1-dependent.", "score": 3, "id": "24664738", "title": "Interaction of tubby-like protein-1 (Tulp1) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1A and MAP1B in the mouse retina."}, {"abstract": "A systems approach was developed and implemented to simulate and analyze motor-assisted axonal transport in nervous system. The methodology employs a Galerkin based linear finite element solver of a system of three coupled partial differential equations governing axonal diffusion-reaction-advection with an efficient optimization algorithm and an experimental time-space series to extract physio-chemical and biological information from experiments and to analyze the dynamics of molecular motor protein-assisted axonal transport. Our simulations were successfully applied and compared to a synthetic dataset based on measured motility parameters as well as experimental data of microtubule-associated protein MAP1A transport in mouse retinal ganglion cells (Nixon et al. 1990) and light neurofilament subunit transport within the optic nerve (Jung and Shea 1999). Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the dependence of the dynamics of axonal transport on model parameters. Based on sensitivity analysis, we recommend a sampling strategy for future experiments that would produce the most sensitive and informative data.

Neuronal microtubules are considered to have a role in dendrite and axon formation. Different portions of the developing and adult brain microtubules are associated with different microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). The roles of each of the different MAPs are not well understood. One of these proteins, MAP1B, is expressed in different portions of the brain and has been postulated to have a role in neuronal plasticity and brain development. To ascertain the role of MAP1B, we generated mice which carry an insertion in the gene by gene-targeting methods. Mice which are homozygous for the modification die during embryogenesis. The heterozygotes exhibit a spectrum of phenotypes including slower growth rates, lack of visual acuity in one or both eyes, and motor system abnormalities. Histochemical analysis of the severely affected mice revealed that their Purkinje cell dendritic processes are abnormal, do not react with MAP1B antibodies, and show reduced staining with MAP1A antibodies. Similar histological and immunochemical changes were observed in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and retina, providing a basis for the observed phenotypes.", "score": 1, "id": "8577753", "title":

expression levels of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A and C subfamilies ABCA1-A9, and ABCC1-6/Mrp1-6, C10/Mrp7 in mouse retinal vascular endothelial cells (RVEC) using a combination of a magnetic isolation method for mouse RVEC and real-time quantitative PCR analysis. The transcript level of endothelial cell markers, such as CD31, Tie-2, claudin-5, occludin, ABCB1a/mdr1a, and ABCG2, were more than 20-fold higher than those in the non-RVEC fraction, suggesting that RVEC in the RVEC fraction are concentrated at least 20-fold compared with those of the non-RVEC fraction. In the ABCA1 to A9 families, the transcript level of ABCA3 and A9 in the RVEC fraction was 1.2- and 32-fold higher than that in the non-RVEC fraction. Although ABCA3 was expressed in both the RVEC and non-RVEC fractions, A9 is predominantly expressed in the RVEC fraction. In the ABCC1 to C6 and C10 families, the transcript level of ABCC3, C4, and C6 in the RVEC fraction was 27-, 251-, and 242-fold higher, respectively, than that in the non-RVEC fraction, suggesting that ABCC3, C4, and C6 are predominantly expressed in the RVEC. In conclusion, ABCA3, ABCA9, ABCC3, ABCC4, and ABCC6 mRNAs are predominantly expressed at the inner blood-retina barrier (inner BRB) and appear to play a major role in the efflux transport of their substrates at the inner BRB.", "score": 3, "id": "17574281", "title": "Gene expression profiles of ATP-binding cassette transporter A and C subfamilies in mouse retinal vascular endothelial cells."}, {"abstract": "Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a mendelian disorder characterized by calcification of elastic fibers in skin, arteries, and retina. It results in dermal lesions, arterial insufficiency and retinal hemorrhages, leading to macular degeneration. PXE is transmitted either as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait and several sporadic cases have been observed. Mutations in the ABCC6 gene have been identified very recently in patients. Here, we report on a large Italian family affected by pseudoxanthoma elasticum for which linkage analysis had pointed to a region encompassing markers D16S3069-D16S405-D16S3103; hemizygosity of marker D16S405 allowed us to detect a submicroscopic deletion of at least 900 kb involving ABCC6, ABCC1, and MYH11. Mutation analysis on the other allele of the family, as well as on two additional sporadic cases, revealed nonsense (Y227X, R518X, R1164X) and frame-shift (c.960delC) mutations in ABCC6 (MRP6) further confirming the role of this multi-drug resistance gene in the etiology of pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Furthermore, clinical re-examination of members of the family harboring the deletion led to the detection of additional features, potentially caused by the deletion of the MYH11 gene. In the course of the analysis five nonpathogenic variants were found in ABCC6: 1233T>C, 1245G>A, 1838 T>G (V614A), 1890C>G, and 3506+83C>A.

MRP1-5 can collectively confer resistance to natural product anticancer drugs and their conjugated metabolites, platinum compounds, folate antimetabolites, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, and alkylating agents. MRP1-3 are often associated with tumor resistance which is often caused by an increased efflux and decreased intracellular accumulation of natural product anticancer drugs and other anticancer agents. Both PGE(1) and PGE(2) are known high-affinity substrates of MRP4, but not MRP1, MRP2, MRP3 and MRP5. LTC(4) is a substrate of MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP6-8. MRP2 is also able to transport LTD(4) and LTE(4). Experimental studies in Abcc1-difficient mice have demonstrated a role of MRP1 in inflammation process in vivo. Abcc3-difficient mice have normal bile salt transport, however they have decreased blood bilirubin glucuronide levels. Abcc6-difficient mice show remarkable mineraliztion of the connective tissues, including skin, arterial blood vessels, and retina. Most MRP/ABCC transporters are subject to inhibition by a variety of compounds. Drug targeting of these transporters to overcome MRP/ABCC-mediated multidrug resistance may play a role in cancer and infection (e.g. HIV infection) chemotherapy. Some modulators of MRPs have shown reversing effects on MDR phenotype in preliminary clinical studies and some modulators of MRPs may modify the inflammatory process and consequently ameliorate the inflammatory symptoms. A better understanding of the interactions of these modulators with MRPs has important implications in development of novel drugs for treatment of cancer, infection and inflammation.", "score": 1,
