Ipsilaterally projecting axons arise from the ventrotemporal (VT) retina and contralaterally projecting axons primarily from the other retinal quadrants. The winged helix transcription factor Foxd1 (previously known as BF-2, Brain Factor 2) is expressed in VT retina, as well as in the ventral diencephalon during the formation of the optic chiasm. We report here that in embryos lacking Foxd1, both retinal development and chiasm morphogenesis are disrupted. In the Foxd1 deficient retina, proteins designating the ipsilateral projection, such as Zic2 and EphB1, are missing, and the domain of Foxg1 (BF-1) expands from nasal retina into the VT crescent. In retina-chiasm co-cultures, VT RGCs from Foxd1 deficient retina are not repulsed by chiasm cells, and in vivo many VT RGCs aberrantly project contralaterally. However, even though the ipsilateral program is lost in the retina, a larger than normal uncrossed component develops in Foxd1 deficient embryos. Chiasm defects include axon stalling in the chiasm and a reduction in the total number of RGCs projecting to the optic tract. In addition, in the Foxd1 deficient ventral diencephalon, Foxg1 invades the Foxd1 domain, Zic2 and Islet1 expression are minimized, and Slit2 prematurely expands, changes that could contribute to axon projection errors. Thus, Foxd1 plays a dual role in the establishment of the binocular visual pathways: first, in specification of the VT retina, acting upstream of proteins directing the ipsilateral pathway; and second, in the patterning of the developing ventral diencephalon where the optic chiasm forms.", "score": 11, "id": "15509772", "title": "Foxd1 is required for proper formation of the optic chiasm."}, {"abstract": "Mammalian binocular vision relies on the divergence of retinal ganglion cell axons at the optic chiasm, with strictly controlled numbers projecting contralaterally and ipsilaterally. In mouse, contralateral projections arise from the entire retina, whereas ipsilateral projections arise from ventrotemporal retina. We investigate how development of these patterns of projection is regulated by the contralateral determinant Foxg1, a forkhead box transcription factor expressed in nasal retina and at the chiasm. In nasal retina, loss of Foxg1 causes increased numbers of ipsilateral projections and ectopic expression of the ipsilateral determinants Zic2, Ephb1 and Foxd1, indicating that nasal retina is competent to express an ipsilateral program that is normally suppressed by Foxg1. Using co-cultures that combine Foxg1-expressing with Foxg1-null retinal explants and chiasm cells, we provide functional evidence that Foxg1 promotes contralateral projections through actions in nasal retina, and that in chiasm cells, Foxg1 is required for the generation of a hitherto unrecognized activity supporting RGC axon growth.", "score": 10, "id": "19004857", "title": "Foxg1 regulates retinal axon pathfinding by repressing an ipsilateral program in nasal retina and by causing optic chiasm cells to exert a net axonal growth-promoting activity."}, {"abstract": "Two winged-helix transcription factors, FoxG1 (previously called chick brain factor1, CBF1) and FoxD1 (chick brain factor2, CBF2), are expressed specifically in the nasal and temporal regions of the developing chick retina, respectively. We previously demonstrated that FoxG1 controls the expression of topographic molecules including FoxD1, and determines the regional specificity of the nasal retina. FoxD1 is known to prescribe temporal specificity, however, molecular mechanisms and downstream targets have not been elucidated. Here we addressed the genetic mechanisms for establishing temporal specificity in the developing retina using an in ovo electroporation technique. Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and Wnt first play pivotal roles in inducing the region-specific expression of FoxG1 and FoxD1 in the optic vesicle. Misexpression of FoxD1 represses the expression of FoxG1, GH6, SOHo1, and ephrin-A5, and induces that of EphA3 in the retina. GH6 and SOHo1 repress the expression of FoxD1. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of FoxG1 on bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling, FoxD1 does not alter the expression of BMP4 or BMP2. Studies with chimeric mutants of FoxD1 showed that FoxD1 acts as a transcription repressor in controlling its downstream targets in the retina. Taken together with previous findings, our data suggest that FoxG1 and FoxD1 are located at the top of the gene cascade for regional specification along the nasotemporal (anteroposterior) axis in the retina, and FoxD1 determines temporal specificity.", "score": 8, "id": "19450575", "title": "Functional mode of FoxD1/CBF2 for the establishment of temporal retinal specificity in the developing chick retina."}, {"abstract": "The organization of the visual system is different in birds and mammals. In both, retinal axons project topographically to the visual targets in the brain; but whereas in birds visual fibers from the entire retina decussate at the optic chiasm, in mammals, a number of axons from the temporal retina diverge at the midline to project ipsilaterally. Gain-of-function experiments in chick raised the hypothesis that the transcription factor Foxd1 specifies retinal temporal identity. However, it remains unknown whether Foxd1 is necessary for this function. In mammals, the crucial role of Foxd1 in the patterning of the optic chiasm region has complicated the interpretation of its cell-autonomous function in the retina. Furthermore, target molecules identified for Foxd1 are different in chicks and mice, leading to question the function of Foxd1 in mammals. Here we show that in the mouse, Foxd1 imprints temporal features in the retina such as axonal ipsilaterality and rostral targeting in collicular areas and that EphA6 is a Foxd1 downstream effector that sends temporal axons to the rostral colliculus. In addition, our data support a model in which the desensitization of EphA6 by ephrinA5 in cis is not necessary for the proper functioning of EphA6. Overall, these results indicate that Foxd1 functions as a conserved determinant of temporal identity but reveal that the downstream effectors, and likely their mechanisms of action, are different in mammals and birds.", "score": 7, "id": "21490208", "title": "Transcription factor Foxd1 is required for the specification of the temporal retina in mammals."}, {"abstract": "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling is an important determinant of vertebrate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) development. In mice, there are two major RGC populations: (1) the Islet2-expressing contralateral projecting (c)RGCs, which both produce and respond to Shh; and (2) the Zic2-expressing ipsilateral projecting RGCs (iRGCs), which lack Shh expression. In contrast to cRGCs, iRGCs, which are generated in the ventrotemporal crescent (VTC) of the retina, specifically express Boc, a cell adhesion molecule that acts as a high-affinity receptor for Shh. In Boc(-/-) mutant mice, the ipsilateral projection is significantly decreased. Here, we demonstrate that this phenotype results, at least in part, from the misspecification of a proportion of iRGCs. In Boc(-/-) VTC, the number of Zic2-positive RGCs is reduced, whereas more Islet2/Shh-positive RGCs are observed, a phenotype also detected in Zic2 and Foxd1 null embryos. Consistent with this observation, organization of retinal projections at the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is altered in Boc(-/-) mice. Analyses of the molecular and cellular consequences of introducing Shh into the developing VTC and Zic2 and Boc into the central retina indicate that Boc expression alone is insufficient to fully activate the ipsilateral program and that Zic2 regulates Shh expression. Taking these data together, we propose that expression of Boc in cells from the VTC is required to sustain Zic2 expression, likely by regulating the levels of Shh signaling from the nearby cRGCs. Zic2, in turn, directly or indirectly, counteracts Shh and Islet2 expression in the VTC and activates the ipsilateral program.", "score": 5, "id": "23678105", "title": "Shh/Boc signaling is required for sustained generation of ipsilateral projecting ganglion cells in the mouse retina."}, {"abstract": "During normal development, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) project axons along the optic nerve to the optic chiasm on the ventral surface of the hypothalamus. In rodents, most RGC growth cones then cross the ventral midline to join the contralateral optic tract; those that do not cross join the ipsilateral optic tract. Contralaterally projecting RGCs are distributed across the retina whereas ipsilaterally projecting RGCs are concentrated in temporal retina. The transcription factor Foxg1 (also known as BF1) is expressed at several key locations along this pathway. Analysis of Foxg1 expression using lacZ reporter transgenes shows that Foxg1 is normally expressed in most, if not all, nasal RGCs but not in most temporal RGCs, neither at the time they project nor earlier in their lineage. Foxg1 is also expressed at the optic chiasm. Mice that lack Foxg1 die at birth and, although the shape of their eyes is abnormal, their retinas still project axons to the brain via the optic chiasm. Using anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, we show that there is an eightfold increase in the ipsilateral projection in Foxg1-/- embryos. The distributions of cells expressing the transcription factors Foxg1 and Nkx2.2, and cell-surface molecules Ephb2, ephrin B2 and SSEA-1 (Fut4) have been correlated to the normally developing retinothalamic projection and we show they are not much altered in the developing Foxg1-/- retina and optic chiasm. As much of the increased ipsilateral projection in Foxg1-/- embryos arises from temporal RGCs that are unlikely to have an autonomous requirement for Foxg1, we propose that the phenotype reflects at least in part a requirement for Foxg1 outwith the RGCs themselves, most likely at the optic chiasm.", "score": 5, "id": "15240555", "title": "The winged helix transcription factor Foxg1 facilitates retinal ganglion cell axon crossing of the ventral midline in the mouse."}, {"abstract": "One of the earliest events in the development of the central nervous system is the establishment of positional identity along the anteroposterior (A-P) axis of the neuroepithelium. In recent years, regulatory genes with regionally restricted expression in the neuroepithelium have been identified which are believed to specify its developmental fate. We have previously described Brain Factor-1 (BF-1), a winged helix (WH) transcription factor expressed in the telencephalic neuroepithelium (Tao and Lai, 1992) Neuron 8:957-966. Here we report the cloning of the mouse cDNA for a novel WH protein, BF-2. We show that BF-2 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein with a binding specificity distinct from BF-1. Its expression in the CNS during embryogenesis is restricted to the rostral diencephalic neuroepithelium. The caudal boundary of BF-2 expression is at the zona limitans intrathalamica. Rostrally, the BF-2 expression domain is adjacent to that of BF-1. The expression domains of these two factors define a boundary within the developing forebrain neuroepithelium. The BF-1/BF-2 boundary also extends laterally to divide the optic stalk and the retina into nasal (anterior) and temporal (posterior) domains. These observations suggest that in addition to playing a role in the subdivision of the forebrain, these two WH factors may also function to establish positional information in the retinal neuroepithelium.", "score": 3, "id": "7815060", "title": "Expression of winged helix genes, BF-1 and BF-2, define adjacent domains within the developing forebrain and retina."}, {"abstract": "Brain factor 1 (BF-1) is a winged-helix transcription factor with restricted expression in the anterior optic vesicle and in the telencephalic neuroepithelium of the neural tube.

Here we show that the loss of BF-1 leads to multiple developmental anomalies of the eyes. The most ventral structure arising from the optic vesicle, the optic stalk, is missing and is replaced by an expanded retina. Ventral closure of the optic cup and choroid fissure does not occur. These dorsal-ventral patterning defects are not limited to the BF-1-expressing (anterior) cells, but also involve the cells of the posterior optic vesicle. Sonic hedgehog (shh) expression within the ventral telencephalic neuroepithelium is specifically lost in the BF-1(-/-) mutant. Taken together, these findings suggest that shh produced at this site plays a role in patterning the developing eye.
