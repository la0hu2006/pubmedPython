"<b>BACKGROUND: </b>The aim of this study was to compare the IgG antibody patterns against retinal antigens in sera of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and healthy subjects to learn more about possible immunological aspects of this disease and to identify some of the most important antigens.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Sera of 140 patients were analyzed: healthy volunteers (CO, n=101) and patients with \"wet\" age-related macular degeneration (AMD, n=39). The sera were tested against western blots of bovine retinal antigens. The IgG antibody patterns were analyzed by multivariate statistical techniques and some antigens were identified via LC-MS/MS.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>All patients showed complex patterns of IgG antibodies against retinal antigens. The discriminant analysis revealed a statistical significant difference between the antibody profiles of the AMD and the CO group (P=0.000023). Not only up-regulations of antigen-antibody-reactivities in the AMD group at some molecular weight ranges, e.g. at 46 and 52 kDa, could be seen, but also down-regulations, e.g. at 18 and 36 kDa. The 18 kDa antigen band was identified as alphaB-crystallin, the band at 46 kDa as alpha-enolase, and one at 52 kDa as glial fibrillary acidic protein.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>We could demonstrate that both groups (wet AMD and CO) show complex IgG antibody patterns against retinal antigens, which are highly specific for each group. This provides further hints for the immunological basis of the disease. These changes in the antibody profiles in \"wet\" AMD could represent a secondary response to retinal damage or can play a causative role in the disease.<br/>", "score": 9, "id": "17058093", "title": "Analysis of IgG antibody patterns against retinal antigens and antibodies to alpha-crystallin, GFAP, and alpha-enolase in sera of patients with \"wet\" age-related macular degeneration."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>Paraneoplastic and autoimmune retinopathies are immunologically mediated retinal degenerations that are associated with antibodies directed against any of several retinal proteins, including alpha-enolase. We report the clinical and electrophysiological features of antienolase retinopathy in contrast to the features of antirecoverin retinopathy.<br/><b>DESIGN: </b>Retrospective, observational case series.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Patients were referred for evaluation of unexplained acquired visual symptoms, including photopsias, and loss of visual acuity or field considered of possible retinal origin. Full-field and multifocal electroretinograms (ERGs) were performed. Sera from patients were examined for antiretinal antibodies by Western blot analysis using proteins extracted from human retinas and by immunohistochemistry; antienolase was confirmed by incubating patient sera with purified alpha-enolase.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Of 87 patients with unexplained retinal visual symptoms associated with abnormal ERGs, 37 (43%) demonstrated autoantibodies to retinal antigens, including 12 against alpha-enolase, of whom 4 had cancer. Initial visual loss was typically central and often asymmetric. The ERGs demonstrated mostly normal rod responses but central cone abnormalities (evident on multifocal ERG) and, for many, global cone abnormalities. Seven patients developed optic disk pallor. Corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, when attempted, was clinically ineffective.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Antienolase retinopathy is a protean autoimmune retinopathy that characteristically presents with cone dysfunction. The visual impairment and course vary from relative stability for years to slow progression with loss of central vision. With time, optic disk pallor can evolve, presumably from attrition of ganglion cells.<br/>", "score": 5, "id": "15860281", "title": "Clinical and electrophysiologic characterization of paraneoplastic and autoimmune retinopathies associated with antienolase antibodies."}, {"abstract": "<b>OBJECTIVE: </b>Autoantibodies to various neuronal proteins frequently accompany lung cancer and their appearance may precede cancer symptoms. In this study we examined which retinal antigens (RAs) are recognized by sera of patients with lung cancer and whether the occurrence of serum antibodies to particular RAs is characteristic for cancer in comparison with a noncancer lung disease.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Sera of 72 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 29 with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), 27 with sarcoidosis (S), and sera of 32 healthy donors were examined in immunoblotting using retinal extracts and purified RAs as antigens.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>69.0% of SCLC, 45.8% of NSCLC, and 44.4% of S sera displayed anti-RAs reactivity. Significantly less (p < 0.05; chi(2) test) percent of healthy control sera reacted with RAs. Lung cancer sera recognized mainly 46-, 56-, and 36-kD and to a smaller extent also 96-, 72-, 43-, and 26-kD proteins. Most of them were recognized with about 2-fold lower frequencies by S and control sera. Only lung cancer sera contained very high-titer antibodies to 46- and 26-kD RAs, identified as alpha-enolase and recoverin, respectively.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>Antibodies to RAs occur more frequently and in higher titers in lung cancer (especially SCLC) than in sarcoidosis or control sera.

Our previous studies demonstrated that ENO1 gene expression was higher in the ovaries of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. However, the molecular characterisation and expression profiling of the ENO1 gene in geese tissues and ovarian follicles remain to be determined. In this study, ENO1 cDNA (1,445 bp long) of the Sichuan white goose was cloned and characterised. The ORF of ENO1 cDNA is 1,305 bp in length and encodes a 434 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 47.27 kDa. ENO1 expression in all of the examined tissues was the highest in spleen and the lowest in breast muscle. High expression of ENO1 appeared in the kidney, liver, adrenal gland, and retina. With increasing follicle growth, ENO1 gene expression began to decrease from the small white follicle to F5, which was followed by a sharp increase in expression in F4 and then a gradual decrease in expression from F3 to F1. Furthermore, in the postovulatory follicles (POF), the levels of ENO1 gene expression decreased gradually from POF1 to POF4. In conclusion, the ENO1 transcript was widely distributed in various tissues of the Sichuan white goose, but ENO1 expression was tissue-specific. Furthermore, the results of the ENO1 expression profiling of ovarian follicles suggest that ENO1 may play an important dual role in the progress of follicular development, where ENO1 acts as a glycolytic enzyme and also mediates apoptosis.", "score": 1, "id": "24413993", "title": "Molecular characterisation and expression profiling of the ENO1 gene in the ovarian follicle of the Sichuan

Specialized versions of primary cilia are involved in many aspects of sensation. The single photoreceptor sensory cilium (PSC) or outer segment elaborated by each rod and cone photoreceptor cell of the retina is a classic example. Mutations in genes that encode cilia components are common causes of disease, including retinal degenerations. The protein components of mammalian primary and sensory cilia have not been defined previously. Here we report a detailed proteomics analysis of the mouse PSC complex. The PSC complex comprises the outer segment and its cytoskeleton, including the axoneme, basal body, and ciliary rootlet, which extends into the inner segment of photoreceptor cells. The PSC complex proteome contains 1968 proteins represented by three or more unique peptides, including approximately 1500 proteins not detected in cilia from lower organisms. This includes 105 hypothetical proteins and 60 proteins encoded by genes that map within the critical intervals for 23 inherited cilia-related disorders, increasing their priority as candidate genes. The PSC complex proteome also contains many cilia proteins not identified previously in photoreceptors, including 13 proteins produced by genes that harbor mutations that cause cilia disease and seven intraflagellar transport proteins. Analyses of PSC complexes from rootletin knock-out mice, which lack ciliary rootlets, confirmed that 1185 of the identified PSC complex proteins are derived from the outer segment. The mass spectrometry data, benchmarked by 15 well characterized outer segment proteins, were used to quantify the copy number of each protein in a mouse rod outer segment. These results reveal mammalian cilia to be several times more complex than the cilia of unicellular organisms and open novel avenues for studies of how cilia are built and maintained and how these processes are disrupted in human disease.", "score": 2, "id": "17494944", "title": "The proteome of the mouse photoreceptor sensory cilium complex."}, {"abstract": "The ciliary rootlet, first recognized over a century ago, is a prominent structure originating from the basal body at the proximal end of a cilium. Despite being the largest cytoskeleton, its structural composition has remained unknown. Here, we report a novel 220-kD protein, designated rootletin, found in the rootlets of ciliated cells. Recombinant rootletin forms detergent-insoluble filaments radiating from the centrioles and resembling rootlets found in vivo. An mAb widely used as a marker for vertebrate rootlets recognizes an epitope in rootletin. Rootletin has a globular head domain and a tail domain consisting of extended coiled-coil structures. Rootletin forms parallel in register homodimers and elongated higher order polymers mediated by the tail domain alone. The head domain may be required for targeting to the basal body and binding to a kinesin light chain. In retinal photoreceptors where rootlets appear particularly robust, rootlets extend from the basal bodies to the synaptic terminals and anchor ER membranes along their length. Our data indicate that rootlets are composed of homopolymeric rootletin protofilaments bundled into variably shaped thick filaments. Thus, rootletin is the long-sought structural component of the ciliary rootlet.", "score": 1, "id": "12427867", "title": "Rootletin, a novel coiled-coil protein, is a structural component of the

[{"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel-2) is a retinal disease that can cause loss of central vision. To gain better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of MacTel-2, we investigated antigens that prompt the generation of retinal autoantibodies in the serum of patients with MacTel-2.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>We screened for the presence of retinal autoantibodies in 45 serum samples collected from patients with MacTel-2 and 58 serum samples from healthy control subjects by Western blot. We then isolated and identified three retinal proteins that are putative targets of three of the most frequently detected autoantibodies in the serum of patients with MacTel-2 using chromatographic fractionation and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. We also validated the retinal location of the three antigens by immunohistochemisty using MacTel-2 sera as primary antibodies and commercial antibodies.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Retinal autoantibodies were detected in a significantly higher proportion of patients with MacTel-2 than in controls (31 of 45 [69%] vs. 9 of 58 [16%], P < 0.0001). The three antigens that were targeted by the most frequently detected MacTel-2 autoantibodies were identified as glycogen debranching enzyme (hereafter AGL, named for the gene symbol AGL), retinol-binding protein 3 (RBP3), and creatine kinase type B (CK-B); autoantibodies against these antigens were found in four, eleven, and nine MacTel-2 serum samples, respectively.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>We found that most patients with MacTel-2 possess retinal autoantibodies, the most prevalent of which were directed against AGL, RBP3, and CK-B. The localization of retinal proteins bound by AGL, RBP3, and CK-B autoantibodies is consistent with their putative physiological functions.

In the juxtafoveal and papillomacular bundle areas, ABGL photocoagulation caused extensive inner retinal damage while KRL photocoagulation spared inner retinal structures. The effects of AGL photocoagulation in the fovea were intermediate in extent between KRL and ABGL photocoagulation.

to dark-adaptation are characteristic of the outer retina. Oxygenation changes may contribute to the selective vulnerability of the retina in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients, especially for those forms involving genes with global cellular functions. Genes coding for components of the U4/U6.U5 tri small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snRNP) complex of the spliceosome stand out, because mutations in four genes cause RP, i.e., RP9 (PAP1), RP11 (PRPF31), RP13 (PRPF8), and RP18 (PRPF3), while there is no degeneration outside the retina despite global expression of these genes. With the assumption that variable oxygenation plays a role in RP forms related to pre-mRNA splicing and the retina and brain are similar, we searched a data collection of ischemia-hypoxia regulated genes of the brain for oxygen regulated genes of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>A database of ischemia-hypoxia response (IHR) genes in the brain was generated from gene expression profiling studies [n=24]. Public databases (NCBI) were searched for RP genes with global function that are expressed in the brain. From the IHR gene list, we extracted genes that were directly related to retinal degeneration through a listed mutation (OMIM, Retnet, RISN). The database was then examined for indirect links to RP forms affecting the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex by searching for IHR genes contributing to this complex. Potential expression of matched genes in the retina was ascertained using NEIBank. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize a selected protein of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex in cynomolgus monkey and human retina specimens.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>The approach identified genes that cause retinal degeneration (CNGB1, SEMA4A, RRG4) or developmental changes (SOX2) when mutated. One IHR gene, Pim1, is the immediate binding partner for PAP1 (RP9). Three IHR genes linked the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex to regulation by oxygenation: PRPF4; SART1, also known as 110 kDa SR-related protein of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP or as hypoxia associated factor (HAF); and LSM8, U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein. The 110 kDa SR-related protein was localized in all retinal cells including photoreceptors.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Regulation by changes in oxygenation within the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRP complex could be particularly important for photoreceptors where oxygen consumption follows a circadian rhythm. If the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRP complex is already impaired by mutations in any of the four genes causing RP, it may be unable to follow properly the physiological demands of oxygenation which are mediated by the four hypoxia-regulated proteins emerging in this study. Selective vulnerability may involve complex combinations of widely expressed genes, specific cellular functions and local energy availability.<br/>", "score": 11, "id": "18334927", "title": "Hypoxia-regulated components of the U4/U6.U5 tri-small nuclear riboprotein complex: possible role in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A) is a member of the transmembrane class 4 family of semaphorins. It has recently been shown to participate in cell-cell communication in the immune system. High levels of sema4A are also present in brain and eye, but its function in the central nervous system has not been studied. To investigate the function of Sema4A, we generated mice deficient in this transmembrane signaling molecule.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>An embryonic stem (ES) cell clone with a retroviral gene-trap insertion in the sema4A gene was used to generate mice lacking this transmembrane semaphorin. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and electroretinography were used to evaluate retinal anatomy and physiology in mice lacking Sema4A. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry with cell-type-specific markers were used to characterize retinal development. In situ hybridization with sema4A-specific riboprobes was used to localize expression of this gene in the developing and adult eye.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Fundus photography performed at 14 weeks of age revealed severe retinal degeneration, attenuated retinal vessels, and depigmentation in mice lacking Sema4A. At this age, the outer nuclear layer was reduced to a single row of photoreceptor cells, and the outer plexiform layer was thin and disorganized. Disruption of Sema4A also compromised the physiological function of both rod and cone photoreceptors. Developmental studies in Sema4A-deficient mice revealed abnormal morphology of photoreceptor outer segments during the time at which they establish contacts with apical microvilli of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Sema4A is expressed in the inner retina and RPE during the time at which photoreceptor outer segments elongate.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>These findings identify a previously unknown function of Sema4A in the developing visual system and provide a useful model for understanding cell-cell interactions that occur between photoreceptors and the RPE.<br/>", "score": 7, "id": "15277503", "title": "Severe retinal degeneration associated with disruption of semaphorin 4A."}, {"abstract": "Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A) has an essential role in photoreceptor survival.

The F350C mutation results in abnormal localization of the Sema4A protein, leading to impaired endosomal sorting of molecules indispensable for photoreceptor survival. Additionally, protein structural modelling reveals that the side chain of the 350th amino acid is critical to retain the proper protein conformation. Furthermore, Sema4A gene transfer successfully prevents photoreceptor degeneration in Sema4A(F350C/F350C) and Sema4A(-/-) mice.

Here, we show that Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A), a member of axonal guidance molecule semaphorin, plays a role in Rab11/FIP2-mediated endosomal sorting in retinal pigment epithelial cells to support photoreceptor function. In response to oxidative stress, Sema4A switches the endosomal sorting of the lysosomal precursor protein prosaposin from the lysosome to the exosomal release, which prevents light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis. In the absence of oxidative stress, Sema4A sorts retinoid-binding proteins with retinoids between the cell surface and endoplasmic reticulum, by which 11-cis-retinal, a chromophore for phototransduction, is regenerated and transported back to photoreceptors. Owing to defects in these processes, Sema4A-deficient mice exhibit marked photoreceptor degeneration.

vertebrate retina, up to 1.5-fold by blocking E/R-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, which is mediated by blocking the release of GABA onto ionotropic GABA-A and GABA-C receptors. In vivo, it is likely that zinc, rather than nickel ions, may be involved in the modulation of retinal signalling. Therefore, we tested the effect of both, ZnCl(2) (10 to 500 microM) and DEDTC (100 to 500 microM), which chelates zinc ions for the capacity to influence the ERG b-wave amplitude.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Transretinal potentials from the isolated bovine retina were recorded as electroretinograms and Ca(2+) inward currents by patch-clamp recordings of stably Ca(v)2.3 transfected HEK-293 cells, yielding an IC(50) value of 5.3 microM for ZnCl(2).<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>ZnCl(2) (10-15 microM) increased the b-wave amplitude by 1.52-fold +/- 0.12 (n = 6 retinas), which was partially reversible upon washout. The same 1.5-fold stimulation of the b-wave amplitude was reported recently for 15 microM NiCl(2).

In vivo evidence for this regulation, however, is scarce and comes almost exclusively from experiments in which normal activity was reduced or blocked completely. Thus, whether spontaneous activity itself promotes synaptogenesis or plays a purely permissive role remains uncertain. In addition, how activity influences synapse dynamics to shape connectivity and whether its effects among neurons are uniform or cell-type-dependent is unclear. In mice lacking the cone-rod homeobox gene (Crx), photoreceptors fail to establish normal connections with bipolar cells (BCs). Here, we find that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in Crx\u207b/\u207b mice become rhythmically hyperactive around the time of eye opening as a result of increased spontaneous glutamate release from BCs. This elevated neurotransmission enhances synaptogenesis between BCs and RGCs, without altering the overall circuit architecture. Using live imaging, we discover that spontaneous activity selectively regulates the rate of synapse formation, not elimination, in this circuit. Reconstructions of the connectivity patterns of three BC types with a shared RGC target further revealed that neurotransmission specifically promotes the formation of multisynaptic appositions from one BC type without affecting the maintenance or elimination of connections from the other two. Although hyperactivity in Crx\u207b/\u207b mice persists, synapse numbers do not increase beyond 4 weeks of age, suggesting closure of a critical period for synaptic refinement in the inner retina. Interestingly, despite their hyperactivity, RGC axons maintain normal eye-specific territories and cell-type-specific layers in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.", "score": 3, "id": "22514306", "title": "Spontaneous activity promotes synapse formation in a cell-type-dependent manner in the developing retina."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>L-type voltage gated calcium channels in retina localize primarily at the presynaptic active zones of photoreceptors and bipolar cells where they modulate glutamate release. However, the pore forming subunit Cacna1s of certain L-type channels is also expressed postsynaptically at the tips of ON bipolar cell dendrites where it colocalizes with mGluR6, but has an unknown function. At these dendritic tips, the components of the mGluR6 signaling cascade cluster together in a macromolecular complex, and each one's localization often depends on that of the others. Thus, we explored if Cacna1s is part of the mGluR6 complex.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>We determined Cacna1s expression by PCR using an ON bipolar library, by Western blotting, and by standard immunohistochemistry.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>The PCR amplification confirmed expression of the transcript in ON bipolar cells, and Western blotting showed the expected bands. Immunostaining for Cacna1s was stronger in the dendritic tips of rod bipolar cells than in those of ON cone bipolar cells. This staining severely decreased in mice missing various mGluR6 cascade elements (Grm6(-/-), Gnao1(-/-), Gnb3(-/-), Gng13(-/-), and Trpm1(-/-)). During development, the ratio of the number of Cacna1s puncta to the number of presynaptic ribbons followed a sigmoidal pattern, rising rapidly from P13 to P17. The mGluR6 expression preceded that of Cacna1s and RGS11.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Our results show that the localization and stability of Cacna1s depend on the expression of mGluR6 and its cascade components, and they suggest that Cacna1s is part of the mGluR6 complex.

L-type VDCCalpha1 subtype expression in wild-type and mutant mice was examined, to investigate the underlying pathologic mechanism.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Two antisera against Cacna1f, and a Cacna1f mouse mutant (Cacna1fDeltaEx14-17) were generated.

Similarly, in the BassoonDeltaEx4-5 mouse, residual mislocalized staining for panalpha1 and Cacna1f showed colocalization. Unlike the presynaptic location of Cacna1f and panalpha1 antibody staining, the skeletal muscle VDCCalpha1 subunit Cacna1s was present postsynaptically at ON-bipolar cell dendrites, where it colocalized with metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6).

Lim1 expressing (+) horizontal progenitor cells (HPCs) have a heterogenic final cell cycle, with some cells undergoing a terminal mitosis on the basal side of the retina. The results in this study show that this terminal basal mitosis of Lim1+ HPCs is not dependent on Chk1/2 for its regulation compared to retinal cells undergoing interkinetic nuclear migration. Neither activating nor blocking Chk1 had an effect on the basal mitosis of Lim1+ HPCs. Furthermore, the Lim1+ HPCs were not sensitive to cisplatin-induced DNA damage and were able to continue into mitosis in the presence of \u03b3-H2AX without activation of caspase-3. However, Nutlin3a-induced expression of p21 did reduce the mitoses, suggesting the presence of a functional p53/p21 response in HPCs. In contrast, the apical mitoses were blocked upon activation of either Chk1/2 or p21, indicating the importance of these proteins during the process of interkinetic nuclear migration.

We explored several possible post-transcriptional mechanisms that may contribute to the elevated levels of MDM4 protein. A proportion of MDM4 transcripts are alternatively spliced to produce protein products that are reported to be more stable and oncogenic. We also discovered that a microRNA predicted to target MDM4 (miR191) was downregulated in retinoblastoma relative to human fetal retinae and a subset of samples had somatic mutations that eliminated the miR-191 binding site in the MDM4 mRNA.

To date, although the lack of intrinsic regenerative potential is well described, a key regulatory molecular mechanism for the enhancement of both axonal regrowth and functional recovery after central nervous system injury remains elusive. While ubiquitin ligases coordinate neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity during development as well as after axonal injury, their role specifically in axonal regeneration is unknown. Following a bioinformatics network analysis combining ubiquitin ligases with previously defined axonal regenerative proteins, we found a triad composed of the ubiquitin ligases MDM4, MDM2 and the transcription factor p53 (encoded by TP53) as a putative central signalling complex restricting the regeneration program. Indeed, conditional deletion of MDM4 or pharmacological inhibition of MDM2/p53 interaction in the eye and spinal cord promote axonal regeneration and sprouting of the optic nerve after crush and of supraspinal tracts after spinal cord injury. The double conditional deletion of MDM4-p53 as well as MDM2 inhibition in p53-deficient mice blocks this regenerative phenotype, showing its dependence upon p53. Genome-wide gene expression analysis from ex vivo fluorescence-activated cell sorting in MDM4-deficient retinal ganglion cells identifies the downstream target IGF1R, whose activity and expression was found to be required for the regeneration elicited by MDM4 deletion. Importantly, we demonstrate that pharmacological enhancement of the MDM2/p53-IGF1R axis enhances axonal sprouting as well as functional recovery after spinal cord injury.

It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder which is clinically divided into three types i.e. type I, type II and type III.

A mutation in any of these genes e.g. CDH23, CLRN1, GPR98, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C, USH1G, USH2A and DFNB31 can result in Usher syndrome or non-syndromic deafness. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play important roles in normal hearing, balance and vision. Studies have shown that protein structures of only seven genes have been determined experimentally and there are still three genes whose structures are unavailable. These genes are Clarin-1, GPR98 and Usherin. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, homology modeling and threading often provide a useful 3D model of a protein. Therefore in the current study Clarin-1 and GPR98 proteins have been analyzed for signal peptide, domains and motifs. Clarin-1 protein was found to be without any signal peptide and consists of prokar lipoprotein domain. Clarin-1 is classified within claudin 2 super family and consists of twelve motifs. Whereas, GPR98 has a 29 amino acids long signal peptide and classified within GPCR family 2 having Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase superfamily. It was found to be consists of GPS and G protein receptor F2 domains and twenty nine motifs. Their 3D structures have been predicted using I-TASSER server. The model of Clarin-1 showed only \u03b1-helix but no beta sheets while model of GPR98 showed both \u03b1-helix and \u03b2 sheets. The predicted structures were then evaluated and validated by MolProbity and Ramachandran plot. The evaluation of the predicted structures showed 78.9% residues of Clarin-1 and 78.9% residues of GPR98 within favored regions.

To understand the biological function of PDZD7 and the pathogenic mechanism caused by PDZD7 mutations, we generated and thoroughly characterized a Pdzd7 knockout mouse model. The Pdzd7 knockout mice exhibit congenital profound deafness, as assessed by auditory brainstem response, distortion product otoacoustic emission and cochlear microphonics tests, and normal vestibular function, as assessed by their behaviors. Lack of PDZD7 leads to the disorganization of stereocilia bundles and a reduction in mechanotransduction currents and sensitivity in cochlear outer hair cells. At the molecular level, PDZD7 determines the localization of the USH2 protein complex, composed of USH2A, GPR98 and WHRN, to ankle links in developing cochlear hair cells, likely through its direct interactions with these three proteins. The localization of PDZD7 to the ankle links of cochlear hair bundles also relies on USH2 proteins. In photoreceptors of Pdzd7 knockout mice, the three USH2 proteins largely remain unchanged at the periciliary membrane complex. The electroretinogram responses of both rod and cone photoreceptors are normal in knockout mice at 1 month of age. Therefore, although the organization of the USH2 complex appears different in photoreceptors, it is clear that PDZD7 plays an essential role in organizing the USH2 complex at ankle links in developing cochlear hair cells.

epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane (BrM), precedes choroidal neovascularization (CNV). We investigated the role of the basement membrane (BM) proteins nidogen-1 and nidogen-2 for the development of experimental CNV. Laser-induced CNV was studied in Nid1(-/-) and Nid2(-/-) mice and wild type (WT) controls by fluorescein angiography, by immune histochemistry of flat-mounts or paraffin sections to analyze expression pattern of nidogen-1 and -2 and nidogen binding BM proteins, and by western blotting. The influence of VEGF and bFGF on the mRNA expression of nidogen-1 was studied in\u00a0vitro. Nidogen-1 protein is present in the BM of the inner limiting membrane (ILM), the retinal capillaries, and the choroid/sclera and CNV. Nidogen-2 protein is also found in these BMs but with a weaker expression in the ILM. In the retina the absence of nidogen-1 does not influence the expression of nidogen-2 and vice versa and does not influence the expression of the BM components collagen IV, laminin \u03b31, and perlecan. In Nid1(-/-) mice, CNV lesions showed increased vessel leakage during angiography and the CNV area was larger than in WT or nidogen-2 deficient mice. Laser treatment led to up-regulation of nidogen-1 protein expression in the sclera/choroid of nidogen-2 deficient or WT mice. The treatment of HUVECs with VEGF leads to a reduced expression of nidogen-1 mRNA whereas its expression remained unchanged in RPE cells. In conclusion, nidogen-1 produced by the endothelial cells acts as a factor to help stabilizing the BM, thus preventing the sprouting of new vessels or the infiltration of endothelial cells. In this sense nidogen-1 is essential to provide an anti-angiogenic environment of differentiated vessels.", "score": 4, "id": "24280453", "title": "Anti-angiogenic effect of the basement membrane protein nidogen-1 in a mouse model of choroidal neovascularization."}, {"abstract": "Cataract is a known condition leading to opacification of the eye lens causing partial or total blindness. Mutations are known to cause autosomal dominant or recessive inherited forms of cataracts in humans, mice, rats, guinea pigs and dogs. The use of large-sized animal models instead of those using mice for the study of this condition has been discussed due to the small size of rodent lenses. Four juvenile-onset cases of bilateral incomplete immature nuclear cataract were recently observed in Romagnola cattle. Pedigree analysis suggested a monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance. In addition to the cataract, one of the cases displayed abnormal head movements. Genome-wide association and homozygosity mapping and subsequent whole genome sequencing of a single case identified two perfectly associated sequence variants in a critical interval of 7.2 Mb on cattle chromosome 28: a missense point mutation located in an uncharacterized locus and an 855 bp deletion across the exon 19/intron 19 border of the bovine nidogen 1 (NID1) gene (c.3579_3604+829del). RT-PCR showed that NID1 is expressed in bovine lenses while the transcript of the second locus was absent. The NID1 deletion leads to the skipping of exon 19 during transcription and is therefore predicted to cause a frameshift and premature stop codon (p.1164fs27X). The truncated protein lacks a C-terminal domain essential for binding with matrix assembly complexes. Nidogen 1 deficient mice show neurological abnormalities and highly irregular crystal lens alterations. This study adds NID1 to the list of candidate genes for inherited cataract in humans and is the first report of a naturally occurring mutation leading to non-syndromic catarct in cattle provides a potential large animal model for human cataract.", "score": 1, "id": "25347398", "title": "Looking the cow in the eye: deletion in the NID1 gene is associated with recessive inherited cataract in Romagnola cattle."}]}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "P", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "141", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "C", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00354609929078009", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "D", "Chr": "1", "freq&#46;controls": "0.000377358490566082", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2650", "LJB_LRT": "1", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "T", "Ref": "T", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "883", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000116962", "Description": "nidogen 1", "End": "236187453", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "NID1", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "1", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "Func": "exonic", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.243", "dbSNP137": "rs200037737", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "NA", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "NID1", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:100", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.999792", "signature": "1_236187453_T_C", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "4296.72", "Omim": "131390", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "pubmed_score": 5, "Gene": "ENSG00000116962", "Obs": "C", "AAChange": "ENSG00000116962:ENST00000264187:exon9:c.A2045G:p.N682S,ENSG00000116962:ENST00000366595:exon9:c.A2045G:p.N682S", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "2", "clean&#46;signature": "1_236187453_T_C", "novel": "FALSE", "rare": "TRUE", "Start": "236187453", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "5e-04", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0.05", "Conserved": "464;Name=lod=103", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "5.5", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "D", "LJB_SIFT": "0.39", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.998329", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "1"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 46, "indel&#46;length": "0", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 0, "results": []}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "D", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "141", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "C", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00354609929078009", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "D", "Chr": "2", "freq&#46;controls": "0.000428449014567289", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2334", "LJB_LRT": "1", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "D", "Ref": "A", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "771", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000134321", "Description": "radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2", "End": "7027078", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "RSAD2", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "1", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "Func": "exonic", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.999", "dbSNP137": "", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "0.000154", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "RSAD2", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:68", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.999945", "signature": "2_7027078_A_G", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "1291.05", "Omim": "607810", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "pubmed_score": 0, "Gene": "ENSG00000134321", "Obs": "G", "AAChange": "ENSG00000134321:ENST00000382040:exon3:c.A521G:p.D174G,ENSG00000134321:ENST00000442639:exon3:c.A317G:p.D106G,ENSG00000134321:ENST00000541728:exon3:c.A200G:p.D67G", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "2", "clean&#46;signature": "2_7027078_A_G", "novel": "FALSE", "rare": "TRUE", "Start": "7027078", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "NA", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0", "Conserved": "426;Name=lod=72", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "5.34", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "D", "LJB_SIFT": "0.97", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.998806", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "1"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 1000, "indel&#46;length": "0", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 1, "results": [{"abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND: </b>Hereditary short stature syndromes are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders and the cause have not been fully identified.

A novel short stature syndrome in Yakuts is reported here, which is characterised by autosomal recessive inheritance, severe postnatal growth retardation, facial dysmorphism with senile face, small hands and feet, normal intelligence, Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly of leucocytes, and optic atrophy with loss of visual acuity and colour vision. This new syndrome is designated as short stature with optic atrophy and Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly (SOPH) syndrome.<br/><b>AIMS: </b>To identify a causative gene for SOPH syndrome.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Genomewide homozygosity mapping was conducted in 33 patients in 30 families.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>The disease locus was mapped to the 1.1 Mb region on chromosome 2p24.3, including the neuroblastoma amplified sequence (NBAS) gene. Subsequently, 33 of 34 patients were identified with SOPH syndrome and had a 5741G/A nucleotide substitution (resulting in the amino acid substitution R1914H) in the NBAS gene in the homozygous state. None of the 203 normal Yakuts individuals had this substitution in the homozygous state. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the NBAS protein is well expressed in retinal ganglion cells, epidermal skin cells, and leucocyte cytoplasm in controls as well as a patient with SOPH

FITC label and confocal analysis revealed that ZnT-3 protein appeared throughout the length of mouse M\u00fcller cells.

Using the mouse retina as a model system, we show that cysteine-rich motor neuron 1 (Crim1), a type I transmembrane protein, is highly expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells. Conditional deletion of the Crim1 gene in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) causes delayed vessel expansion and reduced vessel density. Based on known Vegfa binding by Crim1 and Crim1 expression in retinal vasculature, where angiogenesis is known to be Vegfa dependent, we tested the hypothesis that Crim1 is involved in the regulation of Vegfa signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that VEC-specific conditional compound heterozygotes for Crim1 and Vegfa exhibit a phenotype that is more severe than each single heterozygote and indistinguishable from that of the conditional homozygotes. We further showed that human CRIM1 knockdown in cultured VECs results in diminished phosphorylation of VEGFR2, but only when VECs are required to rely on an autocrine source of VEGFA. The effect of CRIM1 knockdown on reducing VEGFR2 phosphorylation was enhanced when VEGFA was also knocked down. Finally, an anti-VEGFA antibody did not enhance the effect of CRIM1 knockdown in reducing VEGFR2 phosphorylation caused by autocrine signaling, but VEGFR2 phosphorylation was completely suppressed by SU5416, a small-molecule VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor. These data are consistent with a model in which Crim1 enhances the autocrine signaling activity of Vegfa in VECs at least in part via Vegfr2.", "score": 3, "id": "24353059", "title": "Crim1 maintains retinal vascular stability during development by regulating endothelial cell Vegfa autocrine signaling."}, {"abstract": "Crim1 (cysteine-rich motor neuron 1), a novel gene encoding a putative transmembrane protein, has recently been isolated and characterized (Kolle, G., Georgas, K., Holmes, G.P., Little, M.H., Yamada, T., 2000. CRIM1, a novel gene encoding a cysteine-rich repeat protein, is developmentally regulated and implicated in vertebrate CNS development and organogenesis. Mech. Dev. 90, 181-193). Crim1 contains an IGF-binding protein motif and multiple cysteine-rich repeats, analogous to those of chordin and short gastrulation (sog) proteins that associate with TGFbeta superfamily members, namely Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP). High levels of Crim1 have been detected in the brain, spinal chord and lens. As members of the IGF and TGFbeta growth factor families have been shown to influence the behaviour of lens cells (Chamberlain, C.G., McAvoy, J. W., 1997. Fibre differentiation and polarity in the mammalian lens: a key role for FGF. Prog. Ret. Eye Res. 16, 443-478; de Iongh R.U., Lovicu, F.J., Overbeek, P.A., Schneider, M.D., McAvoy J.W., 1999. TGF-beta signalling is essential for terminal differentiation of lens fibre cells. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 40, S561), to further understand the role of Crim1 in the lens, its expression during ocular morphogenesis and growth is investigated. Using in situ hybridisation, the expression patterns of Crim1 are determined in murine eyes from embryonic day 9.5 through to postnatal day 21. Low levels of transcripts for Crim1 are first detected in the lens placode. By the lens pit stage, Crim1 is markedly upregulated with high levels persisting throughout embryonic and foetal development. Crim1 is expressed in both lens epithelial and fibre cells. As lens fibres mature in the nucleus, Crim1 is downregulated but strong expression is maintained in the lens epithelium and in the young fibre cells of the lens cortex.

To identify gene expression differences that might underlie this variability in vulnerability, we have used microarray techniques to describe regional (superior-inferior) variations in gene expression in the retina.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Young adult C57BL/6J mice raised in dim cyclic illumination (12 h at 5 lx and 12 h in darkness) were exposed to hyperoxia (75% oxygen for two weeks). Retinas were collected from hyperoxia-exposed and control animals without fixation and divided into superior and inferior halves. RNA was extracted from each sample, purified, and hybridized to Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix). The consistency of the microarray results was assessed using quantitative PCR for selected genes. Expression data were analyzed to identify genes and ncRNAs whose differential expression between the superior and inferior retina could be associated with relative vulnerability to hyperoxia.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>In control retinas, only two genes showed a fold difference in expression >2 between the superior and inferior retina; another 25 showed a fold difference of 1.5-2.0. Of these 27, the functions of six genes, including ventral anterior homeobox containing gene 2 (Vax2) and T-box 5 (Tbox5), are related to parameters of anatomic development and the functions of five are related to sensory perception. Among the latter, short-wave-sensitive cone opsin (Opn1sw) was more strongly expressed in the inferior retina and medium-wave-sensitive cone opsin (Opn1mw) in the superior retina. This is consistent with known differences in S- and M-cone distribution, confirming our separation of retinal regions. The highest fold difference was reported for membrane metalloendopeptidase (Mme), a member from the metallothionein group of cytoprotective proteins. To identify genes whose regulation by hyperoxia was significantly different between the inferior and superior retina, we calculated the \"fold margin\" (FM, the difference between hyperoxia-induced regulation in the inferior and superior retina) for each gene, and identified genes for which abs(FM) > 0.5. Genes thus identified numbered 112, and included many immune-, cell defense-, and inflammation- related genes.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Gene expression analysis revealed relatively subtle differences between inferior and superior regions of control C57BL/6J retinas, with only 27 genes showing an expression difference >1.5 fold. Among these, genes related to cytoprotection and apoptosis were included, along with genes related to central projections and cone-type differences.

In gain-of-function experiments, most of the eye was sensitive to ventralization when the Hh pathway was activated starting from gastrula/neurula stages. During optic vesicle stages, the dorsal eye became resistant to Hh-dependent ventralization, but this pathway could partially upregulate optic stalk markers within the retina. In loss-of-function assays, inhibition of Hh signalling starting from neurula stages caused expansion of the dorsal retina at the expense of the ventral retina and the optic stalk, while the effects of Hh inhibition during optic vesicle stages were limited to the reduction of optic stalk size.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Our results suggest the existence of two competence windows during which the Hh pathway differentially controls patterning of the eye region. In the first window, between the neural plate and the optic vesicle stages, Hh signalling exerts a global influence on eye dorsoventral polarity, contributing to the specification of optic stalk, ventral retina and dorsal retinal domains.

Here we demonstrate that spatiotemporal misexpression of Vax2os1 determines cell cycle alterations in photoreceptor progenitor cells. In particular, the overexpression of Vax2os1 in the developing early postnatal mouse retina causes an impaired cell cycle progression of photoreceptor progenitors toward their final committed fate and a consequent delay of their differentiation processes. At later developmental stages, this perturbation is accompanied by an increase of apoptotic events in the photoreceptor cell layer, in comparison with control retinas, without affecting the proper cell layering in the adult retina. Similar results are observed in mouse photoreceptor-derived 661W cells in which Vax2os1 overexpression results in an impairment of the cell cycle progression rate and cell differentiation. Based on these results, we conclude that Vax2os1 is involved in the control of cell cycle progression of photoreceptor progenitor cells in the ventral retina.

BMP4 signaling gradients were manipulated in whole mouse embryo cultures during optic cup development, by implantation of beads soaked in BMP4, or the BMP antagonist Noggin, to provide a local signaling source. Tbx2, Tbx3 and Tbx5, showed a differential response to alterations in the level of BMP4 along the entire dorso-ventral axis of the optic cup, suggesting that BMP4 acts across a distance. Increased levels of BMP4 caused expansion of Tbx2 and Tbx3, but not Tbx5, into the ventral retina and repression of the ventral marker Vax2. Conversely, Noggin abolished Tbx5 expression but only shifted Tbx2 expression dorsally.

also a mutation hotspot in human X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 3 (RP3). The XLPRA1 form of disease has shown extensive phenotypic variability in a colony of dogs that all inherited the same mutant X-chromosome. This variability in onset and severity makes XLPRA1 a valuable model to use to identify genes influencing photoreceptors degeneration in dog and to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying RP in its human homolog. In this study, RPGRIP1, RANBP2, NPM1, PDE6D, NPHP5, and ABCA4 genes were selected on the basis of interaction with RPGR or RPGRIP1 or their implication in related retinal diseases, and were investigated as candidate genetic modifiers of XLPRA1.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>A pedigree derived from an affected male dog outcrossed to unrelated normal mix bred or purebred females was used. Morphologic examination revealed phenotypic variability in the affected dogs characterized as mild, moderate, or severe. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indel-containing markers spanning the entire genes were designed, based on the canine sequence and the Broad Institute SNP library, and genotyped on the pedigree. For each candidate gene, haplotypes were identified and their frequencies in severely and moderately affected dogs were compared to detect a putative correlation between a gene-specific haplotype(s), and severity level of the disease. Primers were derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and predicted transcripts to assess the relative retinal expression of the six genes of interest in normal and affected retinas of different ages.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Four to seven haplotypes per gene were identified. None of the haplotypes of RPGRIP1, NPM1, PDE6D, NPHP5, RANBP2, and ABCA4 were found to co-segregate with the moderate or severe phenotype. No significant difference in the retinal expression levels of the candidate genes was observed between normal and affected dogs.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The haplotype distribution of RPGRIP1, NPM1, PDE6D, NPHP5, RANBP2, and ABCA4 suggests these genes are not modifiers of the disease phenotype observed in the XLPRA1 pedigree. The RPGRORF15 stop mutation does not affect the retinal expression of these genes at the mRNA level in the pre-degenerate stage of disease, but no conclusions can be made at this time about changes that may occur at the protein level.<br/>", "score": 7, "id": "17653054", "title": "Analysis of six candidate genes as potential modifiers of disease expression in canine XLPRA1, a model for human X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 3."}, {"abstract": "Many components and pathways transducing multifaceted and deleterious effects of stress stimuli remain ill-defined.

MPTP led to stronger akinetic parkinsonism and slower recovery in Ranbp2 (+/-) than wild-type mice without viability changes of brain TH(+)-neurons of either genotype, with the exception of transient nuclear atypia via changes in chromatin condensation of Ranbp2 (+/-) TH(+)-neurons. Conversely, the number of wild-type retinal TH(+)-amacrine neurons compared to Ranbp2 (+/-) underwent milder declines without apoptosis followed by stronger recoveries without neurogenesis. These phenotypes were accompanied by a stronger rise of EdU(+)-proliferative cells and non-proliferative gliosis of GFAP(+)-M\u00fcller cells in wild-type than Ranbp2 (+/-) that outlasted the MPTP-insult.

Mutations in RPGR are implicated in heterogeneous retinal phenotypes, while those in RPGRIP1 lead to Leber congenital amaurosis. RPGR and RPGRIP1s differentially localize in photoreceptors among species. This may contribute to phenotype disparities among species bearing mutations in RPGR. However, it cannot account for the phenotype heterogeneity associated with RPGR- and RPGRIP1-linked mutations in the human. The existence of RPGRIP1 isoforms with distinct cellular, subcellular localizations and biochemical properties in the retina is shown. High mass RPGRIP1 isoforms, p175/p150, enriched in the outer segment (OS) compartment of photoreceptors are identified. The remaining isoforms are present across subcellular fractions, including nuclei and are soluble. The p175/p150 are predominantly sequestered in the cytoskeleton-insoluble fraction of OS and nuclei. In selective amacrine cells, and in the transformed photoreceptor line, 661W, RPGRIP1s localize at restricted foci to nuclear pore complexes and/or the vicinity of these. Among the nucleoporins, RPGRIP1 isoforms selectively associate in vivo with RanBP2 (Nup358). RPGRIP1s also decorate microtubules in 661W cells and occasionally form coiled-like inclusion bodies in the perikarya. These results support distinct but complementary functions of RPGRIP1 isoforms in cytoskeletal-mediated processes in photoreceptors and amacrine neurons, and may explain the Leber phenotype linked to RPGRIP1 mutations in humans.

Insufficiency of RAN-binding protein-2 (RANBP2), a large, mosaic protein with pleiotropic functions, suppresses apoptosis of photoreceptor neurons upon aging and light-elicited oxidative stress, and promotes age-dependent tumorigenesis by mechanisms that are not well understood. Here we show that, by downregulating selective partners of RANBP2, such as RAN GTPase, UBC9 and ErbB-2 (HER2; Neu), and blunting the upregulation of a set of orphan nuclear receptors and the light-dependent accumulation of ubiquitylated substrates, light-elicited oxidative stress and Ranbp2 haploinsufficiency have a selective effect on protein homeostasis in the retina. Among the nuclear orphan receptors affected by insufficiency of RANBP2, we identified an isoform of COUP-TFI (Nr2f1) as the only receptor stably co-associating in vivo with RANBP2 and distinct isoforms of UBC9. Strikingly, most changes in proteostasis caused by insufficiency of RANBP2 in the retina are not observed in the supporting tissue, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Instead, insufficiency of RANBP2 in the RPE prominently suppresses the light-dependent accumulation of lipophilic deposits, and it has divergent effects on the accumulation of free cholesterol and free fatty acids despite the genotype-independent increase of light-elicited oxidative stress in this tissue. Thus, the data indicate that insufficiency of RANBP2 results in the cell-type-dependent downregulation of protein and lipid homeostasis, acting on functionally interconnected pathways in response to oxidative stress.

The neural retina comprises a mosaic of rod and cone photoreceptors. Cone and rod photoreceptors degenerate upon rod-specific expression of heterogeneous mutations in functionally distinct genes, whereas cone-specific mutations are thought to cause only cone demise. Here we show that conditional ablation in cone photoreceptors of Ran-binding protein-2 (Ranbp2), a cell context-dependent pleiotropic protein linked to neuroprotection, familial necrotic encephalopathies, acute transverse myelitis and tumor-suppression, promotes early electrophysiological deficits, subcellular erosive destruction and non-apoptotic death of cones, whereas rod photoreceptors undergo cone-dependent non-autonomous apoptosis. Cone-specific Ranbp2 ablation causes the temporal activation of a cone-intrinsic molecular cascade highlighted by the early activation of metalloproteinase 11/stromelysin-3 and up-regulation of Crx and CoREST, followed by the down-modulation of cone-specific phototransduction genes, transient up-regulation of regulatory/survival genes and activation of caspase-7 without apoptosis. Conversely, PARP1+ -apoptotic rods develop upon sequential activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and loss of membrane permeability. Rod photoreceptor demise ceases upon cone degeneration. These findings reveal novel roles of Ranbp2 in the modulation of intrinsic and extrinsic cell death mechanisms and pathways. They also unveil a novel spatiotemporal paradigm of progression of neurodegeneration upon cell-specific genetic damage whereby a cone to rod non-autonomous death pathway with intrinsically distinct cell-type death manifestations is triggered by cell-specific loss of Ranbp2.

Their functions in vivo, however, are not well understood. Two new retinal cyclophilin isoforms, types I and II, are highly expressed in cone photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina. Type-II cyclophilin is identical to RanBP2, a large protein that binds the GTPase Ran. Here we report that two contiguous domains in RanBP2, Ran-binding domain 4 (RBD4) and cyclophilin, act in concert as a chaperone for the opsin molecule of the red/green-sensitive visual pigment of a dichromatic vertebrate. In Drosophila, the cyclophilin NinaA is expressed in all photoreceptors and is required for the expression of only a subset of opsins. The molecular basis of these photoreceptor class-specific effects and the functions of NinaA and other cyclophilins in vivo remain unclear. Unlike NinaA, which forms a stable complex with opsin from retinular cells R1-6, we find that the cyclophilin domain of RanBP2 does not bind opsin directly; rather, it augments and stabilizes the interaction between red/green (R/G) opsin and the RBD4 domain. This involves a cyclophilin-mediated modification of R/G opsin, possibly involving proline isomerization. The RBD4-cyclophilin supradomain of RanBP2, therefore, is a form of vertebrate chaperone of defined substrate specificity, which may be involved in the processing and/or transport of long-wavelength opsin in cone photoreceptor cells.", "score": 2, "id": "8857542", "title": "Cyclophilin-related protein RanBP2 acts as chaperone for red/green opsin."}, {"abstract": "Prolonged light exposure is a determinant factor in inducing neurodegeneration of photoreceptors by apoptosis.

Notably, haploinsufficiency of Ran-binding protein-2 (RanBP2) suppresses apoptosis and most facets of membrane dysgenesis observed with age upon light-elicited stress. RanBP2 haploinsufficiency promotes decreased levels of free fatty acids in the retina independent of light exposure and turns the mice refractory to weight gain on a high-fat diet, whereas light promotes an increase in hydrogen peroxide regardless of the genotype. These studies demonstrate the presence of age-dependent and RanBP2-mediated pathways modulating membrane biogenesis of the outer segments and light-elicited neurodegeneration of photoreceptors.

The 19S regulatory particle (RP) of the 26S proteasome mediates the recognition, deubiquitylation, unfolding, and channeling of ubiquitylated substrates to the 20S proteasome. Several subunits of the 19S RP interact with a growing number of factors. The cyclophilin-like domain (CLD) of Ran-binding protein-2 (RanBP2/Nup358) associates specifically with at least one subunit, S1, of the base subcomplex of the 19S RP, but the functional implications of this interaction on the UPS activity are elusive. This study shows the CLD of RanBP2 promotes selectively the accumulation of a subset of reporter substrates of the UPS, such as the ubiquitin (Ub)-fusion yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) degradation substrate, Ub(G76V)-YFP, and the N-end rule substrate, Ub-R-YFP. Conversely, the degradation of endoplasmic reticulum and misfolded proteins, and of those linked to UPS-independent degradation, is not affected by CLD. The selective effect of CLD on the UPS in vivo is independent of, and synergistic with, proteasome inhibitors, and CLD does not affect the intrinsic proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome. The inhibitory activity of CLD on the UPS resides in a purported SUMO binding motif. We also found two RanBP2 substrates, RanGTPase-activating protein and retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein-1alpha1, whose steady-state levels are selectively modulated by CLD. Hence, the CLD of RanBP2 acts as a novel auxiliary modulator of the UPS activity; it may contribute to the molecular and subcellular compartmentation of the turnover of properly folded proteins and modulation of the expressivity of several neurological diseases.", "score": 1, "id": "17911097", "title": "The cyclophilin-like domain of Ran-binding protein-2 modulates selectively the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and protein biogenesis."}, {"abstract": "Ran-binding proteins, karyopherins, and RanGTPase mediate and impart directionality to nucleocytoplasmic transport processes. This biological process remains elusive in neurons. RanBP2 has been localized at the nuclear pore complexes and is very abundant in the neuroretina. RanBP2 mediates the assembly of a large complex comprising RanGTPase, CRM1/exportin-1, importin-beta, KIF5-motor proteins, components of the 19S cap of the 26S proteasome, ubc9 and opsin. Here, we show RanBP2 is abundant in the ellipsoid compartment of photoreceptors and RanGTPase-positive particles in cytoplasmic tracks extending away from the nuclear envelope of subpopulations of ganglion cells, suggesting RanBP2's release from nuclear pore complexes. KIF5C and KIF5B are specifically expressed in a subset of neuroretinal cells and differentially localize with RanBP2 and importin-beta in distinct compartments. The C-terminal domains of KIF5B and KIF5C, but not KIF5A, associate directly with importin-beta in a RanGTPase-dependent fashion in vivo and in vitro, indicating importin-beta is an endogenous cargo for a subset of KIF5s in retinal neurons. The KIF5 transport pathway is absent from the myoid region of a topographically distinct subclass of blue cones and the distribution of kinesin-light chains is largely distinct from its KIF5 partners. Altogether, the results identify the existence of neuronal- and subtype-specific kinesin-mediated transport pathways of importin-beta-bound cargoes to and/or from RanBP2 and indicate RanBP2 itself may also constitute a scaffold carrier for some of its associated partners.

Type I cyclophilin is a shorter, alternatively spliced isoform of RanBP2. Recently, we showed that the Ran-binding domain 4 (RBD4)/cyclophilin (CY) supradomain of RanBP2 acts both in vitro and in vivo as a specific chaperone for bovine red/green opsin (R/G opsin). R/G opsin undergoes a stable modification of its electrophoretic mobility upon binding to RanBP2. This modification is likely due to cis-trans isomerization of one or more proline residues in the opsin protein. Here, we show that expression of human red opsin in Escherichia coli and COS cells results in the production of still a third electrophoretic variant of this protein. This variant was converted to the RBD4 binding-competent form of opsin through direct interaction with RBD4/CY, both in vivo and in vitro. We suggest that these distinct opsin species may represent kinetically or thermodynamically trapped prolyl conformers that can be interconverted by concerted action of the RBD4 and CY domains of RanBP2. We also show that the C-terminal half of RBD4 is the binding domain for bovine R/G opsin and that coexpression of human red opsin with type I cyclophilin in vivo enhances the production of functional visual pigment. These observations imply that prolyl isomerization may have importance beyond its role in protein folding, possibly as a molecular switch modulated by cyclophilin for the loading of opsin onto RanBP2 during visual pigment processing in cones.", "score": 1, "id": "9037092", "title": "Interconversion of red opsin isoforms by the cyclophilin-related chaperone protein Ran-binding protein 2."}]}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "D", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "123", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "N", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00813008130081305", "SegDup": "0.97", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "N", "Chr": "2", "freq&#46;controls": "0.00554733727810652", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_LDS_4011_F1373;IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "1352", "LJB_LRT": "0.886927", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "T", "Ref": "C", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "457", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000153201", "Description": "RAN binding protein 2", "End": "109384494", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "RANBP2", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "2", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "2", "Func": "exonic", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.98", "dbSNP137": "rs140280672", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "0.001538", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "RANBP2", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:100", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.059486", "signature": "2_109384494_C_T", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "77421.66", "Omim": "601181", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "TRUE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0.00218818380743979", "pubmed_score": 26, "Gene": "ENSG00000153201", "Obs": "T", "AAChange": "ENSG00000153201:ENST00000283195:exon20:c.C7499T:p.T2500I", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "15", "clean&#46;signature": "2_109384494_C_T", "novel": "FALSE", "rare": "FALSE", "Start": "109384494", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "9e-04", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0.127659574468085", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0.02", "Conserved": "516;Name=lod=166", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "3.45", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "NA", "LJB_SIFT": "0.56", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.932552", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "2"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 6, "indel&#46;length": "0", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 0, "results": []}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "D", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "141", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "N", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00709219858156029", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "N", "Chr": "2", "freq&#46;controls": "0.00177444794952686", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_LDS_4008_F1374;IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2536", "LJB_LRT": "0.995208", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "T", "Ref": "C", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "827", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000153093", "Description": "acyl-CoA oxidase-like", "End": "111850512", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "ACOXL", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "2", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "Func": "exonic", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.972", "dbSNP137": "", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "NA", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "ACOXL", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:70", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.359259", "signature": "2_111850512_C_T", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "13918.72", "Omim": "", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "pubmed_score": 0, "Gene": "ENSG00000153093", "Obs": "T", "AAChange": "ENSG00000153093:ENST00000417074:exon11:c.C1025T:p.T342I,ENSG00000153093:ENST00000439055:exon17:c.C1511T:p.T504I,ENSG00000153093:ENST00000389811:exon18:c.C1601T:p.T534I", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "9", "clean&#46;signature": "2_111850512_C_T", "novel": "FALSE", "rare": "TRUE", "Start": "111850512", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "NA", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0.01", "Conserved": "369;Name=lod=42", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "0.734", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "N", "LJB_SIFT": "0.91", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.243764", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "2"}, {"splicing": "TRUE", "pred_score": 1000, "indel&#46;length": "0", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 8, "results": [{"abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND: </b>As a leading cause of adult blindness, diabetic retinopathy is a prevalent and profound complication of diabetes.

Transcriptomic profiling through microarray analysis was included to identify additional targets and assess potential regulation of protein expression changes at the mRNA level. The proteomic approaches proved complementary, with limited overlap in proteomic coverage. Alterations in pro-inflammatory, signaling and crystallin family proteins were confirmed by orthogonal methods in multiple independent animal cohorts. In an independent experiment, insulin replacement therapy normalized the expression of some proteins (Dbi, Anxa5) while other proteins (Cp, Cryba3, Lgals3, Stat3) were only partially normalized and Fgf2 and Crybb2 expression remained elevated.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: </b>These results expand the understanding of the changes in retinal protein expression occurring with diabetes and their responsiveness to normalization of blood glucose through insulin therapy.

Since DBI is identical with the acyl-CoA binding protein, which has the ability to bind long chain acyl-CoA esters, the major function of DBI may possibly be related to lipid metabolism. This idea was supported by our previous study showing the consistent coexpression of DBI and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) in epithelia throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The present histochemical study focused on the distribution of DBI in neural tissues, and revealed a definite existence of DBI in non-neuronal supporting cells in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the brain, intense immunoreactivity for DBI was detected in the cerebellar Bergmann glia, olfactory ensheathing glia, subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus, and retinal Muller cells. In the peripheral nervous system, satellite cells in sensory/autonomic ganglia, Schwann cells, and sustentacular cells in the adrenal medulla were immunoreactive to a DBI antibody. Moreover, the colocalization of DPI and brain-type FABP (B-FABP) was observed in most of the non-neuronal supporting cells mentioned above, indicating that DBI and B-FABP are cooperatively involved in

PDE1C is confined mainly to the inner retina, with a precise localization in the inner nuclear layer.

(PRA) in dogs, the canine equivalent of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in humans, is characterised by vision loss due to degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in the retina, eventually leading to complete blindness. It affects more than 100 dog breeds, and is caused by numerous mutations. RP affects 1 in 4000 people in the Western world and 70% of causal mutations remain unknown. Canine diseases are natural models for the study of human diseases and are becoming increasingly useful for the development of therapies in humans. One variant, prcd-PRA, only accounts for a small proportion of PRA cases in the Golden Retriever (GR) breed. Using genome-wide association with 27 cases and 19 controls we identified a novel PRA locus on CFA37 (p(raw)\u200a=\u200a1.94\u00d710(-10), p(genome)\u200a=\u200a1.0\u00d710(-5)), where a 644 kb region was homozygous within cases. A frameshift mutation was identified in a solute carrier anion exchanger gene (SLC4A3) located within this region. This variant was present in 56% of PRA cases and 87% of obligate carriers, and displayed a recessive mode of inheritance with full penetrance within those lineages in which it segregated. Allele frequencies are approximately 4% in the UK, 6% in Sweden and 2% in France, but the variant has not been found in GRs from the US.

Immunobloting analysis revealed that Na+/HCO3- co-transporter (NBC1), and carbonic anhydrase II and CAXIV, protein expression were elevated in Slc4a3-/- mouse retinas, suggesting compensation for loss of AE3. TUNEL staining showed increased numbers of apoptotic nuclei from 4-6 months of age, in Slc4a3-/- mice, indicating late onset photoreceptor death.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: </b>Identification of Slc4a3 as underlying a previously unrecognized cause of blindness suggests this gene as a new candidate for a subset of hereditary vitreoretinal retinal degeneration.<br/>", "score": 7, "id": "17786210", "title": "Blindness caused by deficiency in AE3 chloride/bicarbonate exchanger."}, {"abstract": "Plasma membrane anion exchangers constitute a multigene family that contributes to the regulation of intracellular pH and chloride concentration in many cell types.

Treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) increased Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange activity of WT and AE3(fl)-A867D to a similar degree, which was abolished by preincubation with the protein kinase A (PKA)-specific inhibitor H89. This indicates that PKA regulates WT and AE3(fl)-A867D Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange activity. No difference in Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange activity was found between cultures of mixed populations of neonatal hippocampal cells from WT and slc4a3(-/-) mice. We conclude that the A867D allele is a functional (catalytic) mutant of AE3 and that the decreased activity of AE3(fl)-A867D may cause changes in cell volume and abnormal intracellular pH. In the brain, these alterations may promote neuron hyperexcitability and the generation of seizures.", "score": 1, "id": "19605733", "title": "Characterization of an epilepsy-associated variant of the

Here we report a key role of a short N-terminal domain of HDAC4 in photoreceptor protection. Expression of this domain suppresses multiple cell death pathways in photoreceptor degeneration, and preserves even more rd1 rods than the full-length HDAC4 protein. Expression of a short N-terminal domain of HDAC4 as a transgene in mice carrying the rd1 mutation also prolongs the survival of cone photoreceptors, and partially restores visual function.

We further determined a quantitative pattern of specific HDACs expressed in various human and mouse neural tissues. In human AD frontal cortex, HDAC1,2 decreased 32%, HDAC5 increased 47%, and HDAC6 increased 31% in comparison to age-matched controls. Human neural retina concentrations of HDAC1, 2, HDAC5, HDAC6, and HDAC7 decreased in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-affected donors and exhibited a greater decrease in AD-affected donors in comparison to age-matched control neural retinas. Additionally, HDAC concentrations were measured in whole hemisphere of brain of 5XFAD mice, a model of \u03b2-amyloid deposition, to assess similarity to AD in human frontal cortex. HDAC profiles of human frontal cortex and mouse hemisphere had noticeable differences and relatively high concentrations of HDAC3 and HDAC4 in mice, which were undetectable in humans.

As a step toward analyzing the role of HDAC4 in the regulation of neuronal survival in more detail, we generated two separate lines of conditional knockout mice by breeding HDAC4-flox mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase through a Thy1 or nestin promoter. Surprisingly, both Thy1-Cre/HDAC4(-/-) mice, in which HDAC4 is ablated in neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, as well as Nes-Cre/HDAC4(-/-) mice, in which HDAC4 is ablated in neural progenitor cells of the CNS, appear normal at birth, have normal body weight, are fertile, and perform normally in locomotor activity assays. Histological analysis of the brains of Nes-Cre/HDAC4(-/-) mice revealed no obvious abnormalities in cytoarchitecture. Immunohistological analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin also showed no discernible defects. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling staining showed no difference in the level of neuronal death in the cortex and cerebellum of Nes-Cre/HDAC4(-/-) mice compared with controls.

"Corneal integrity and transparency are indispensable for good vision. Cornea homeostasis is entirely dependent upon corneal stem cells, which are required for complex wound-healing processes that restore corneal integrity following epithelial damage. Here, we found that leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is highly expressed in the human holoclone-type corneal epithelial stem cell population and sporadically expressed in the basal cells of ocular-surface epithelium. In murine models, LRIG1 regulated corneal epithelial cell fate during wound repair. Deletion of Lrig1 resulted in impaired stem cell recruitment following injury and promoted a cell-fate switch from transparent epithelium to keratinized skin-like epidermis, which led to corneal blindness. In addition, we determined that LRIG1 is a negative regulator of the STAT3-dependent inflammatory pathway. Inhibition of STAT3 in corneas of Lrig1-/- mice rescued pathological phenotypes and prevented corneal opacity. Additionally, transgenic mice that expressed a constitutively active form of STAT3 in the corneal epithelium had abnormal features, including corneal plaques and neovascularization similar to that found in Lrig1-/- mice. Bone marrow chimera experiments indicated that LRIG1 also coordinates the function of bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells. Together, our data indicate that LRIG1 orchestrates corneal-tissue transparency and cell fate during repair, and identify LRIG1 as a key regulator of tissue homeostasis.", "score": 1, "id": "24316976", "title": "LRIG1 inhibits STAT3-dependent inflammation to maintain corneal homeostasis."}]}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "D", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "141", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "C", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00354609929078009", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "N", "Chr": "3", "freq&#46;controls": "0.0012417218543046", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2416", "LJB_LRT": "0.999997", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "D", "Ref": "C", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "797", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000144749", "Description": "leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1", "End": "66431055", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "LRIG1", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "1", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "2", "Func": "exonic", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.854", "dbSNP137": "rs146580942", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "0.001845", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "LRIG1", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:100", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.260885", "signature": "3_66431055_C_T", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "17300.91", "Omim": "608868", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0.00125470514429105", "pubmed_score": 1, "Gene": "ENSG00000144749", "Obs": "T", "AAChange": "ENSG00000144749:ENST00000273261:exon18:c.G3001A:p.D1001N,ENSG00000144749:ENST00000383703:exon19:c.G2932A:p.D978N", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "6", "clean&#46;signature": "3_66431055_C_T", "novel": "FALSE", "rare": "FALSE", "Start": "66431055", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "0.0014", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0.01", "Conserved": "472;Name=lod=110", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "5.27", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "D", "LJB_SIFT": "0.98", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.998899", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "1"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 2, "indel&#46;length": "0", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 3, "results": [{"abstract": "Pdzrn3, a member of the PDZRN/SEMCAP/LNX protein family containing a RING finger and two PDZ domains, has been implicated in myoblast and osteoblast differentiation.

nmf240.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Mice from a G3 N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis program were screened by indirect ophthalmoscopy for abnormal fundi. A chromosomal position for the recessive nmf240 mutation was determined by a genome-wide linkage analysis by use of simple sequence length polymorphic markers in an F2 intercross. The critical region was refined, and candidate genes were screened by direct sequencing. The nmf240 phenotype was characterized by histologic analysis of the retina, brain, and male reproductive organs and by electroretinogram (ERG)-based studies of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Clinically, homozygous nmf240 mutants exhibit a grainy retina that progresses to panretinal patches of depigmentation. The mutation was localized to a region on chromosome 16 containing Clcn2, a gene associated with retinal degeneration. Sequencing identified a missense C-T mutation at nucleotide 1063 in Clcn2 that converts a glutamine to a stop codon. Mice homozygous for the Clcn2(nmf240) mutation experience a severe loss of photoreceptor cells at 14 days of age that is preceded by an elongation of RPE apical microvilli. Homozygous mutants also experience leukoencephalopathy in multiple brain areas and male sterility. Despite a normal retinal histology in nmf240 heterozygotes, the ERG light peak, generated by the RPE, is reduced.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The nmf240 phenotype closely resembles that reported for Clcn2 knockout mice. The observation that heterozygous nmf240 mice present with a reduced ERG light peak component suggests that CLCN2 is necessary for the generation of this response component.<br/>", "score": 6, "id": "20071672", "title": "Photoreceptor degeneration, azoospermia, leukoencephalopathy, and abnormal RPE cell function in mice expressing an early stop mutation in CLCN2."}, {"abstract": "ClC-2 is a broadly expressed plasma membrane chloride channel that is modulated by voltage, cell swelling, and pH. A human mutation leading to a heterozygous loss of ClC-2 has previously been reported to be associated with epilepsy, whereas the disruption of Clcn2 in mice led to testicular and retinal degeneration. We now show that the white matter of the brain and spinal cord of ClC-2 knock-out mice developed widespread vacuolation that progressed with age. Fluid-filled spaces appeared between myelin sheaths of the central but not the peripheral nervous system. Neuronal morphology, in contrast, seemed normal. Except for the previously reported blindness, neurological deficits were mild and included a decreased conduction velocity in neurons of the central auditory pathway. The heterozygous loss of ClC-2 had no detectable functional or morphological consequences. Neither heterozygous nor homozygous ClC-2 knock-out mice had lowered seizure thresholds.

To determine the nature of the hyperpolarization-activated Cl(-) current and to examine the role of ClC-2 in salivary gland function, a mouse line containing a targeted disruption of the Clcn2 gene was generated. The resulting homozygous Clcn2(-/-) mice lacked detectable hyperpolarization-activated chloride currents in parotid acinar cells and, as described previously, displayed postnatal degeneration of the retina and testis. The magnitude and biophysical characteristics of the volume- and calcium-activated chloride currents in these cells were unaffected by the absence of ClC-2. Although ClC-2 appears to contribute to fluid secretion in some cell types, both the initial and sustained salivary flow rates were normal in Clcn2(-/-) mice following in vivo stimulation with pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist. In addition, the electrolytes and protein contents of the mature secretions were normal. Because ClC-2 has been postulated to contribute to cell volume control, we also examined regulatory volume decrease following cell swelling. However, parotid acinar cells from Clcn2(-/-) mice recovered volume with similar efficiency to wild-type littermates.

We have shown previously that a number of complement components and regulators can be produced locally in the eye, and that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are the major source of complement expression at the retina-choroidal interface. The expression of complement components by RPE cells is regulated by inflammatory cytokines. Under aging or inflammatory conditions, microglia and macrophages accumulate in the subretinal space, where they are in close contact with RPE cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of activated macrophages on complement expression by RPE cells. Mouse RPE cells were treated with the supernatants from un-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-DMs), the classically activated BM-DMs (M1) and different types of the alternatively activated BM-DMs (M2a by IL-4, M2b by immune complex and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), M2c by IL-10). The expression of inflammatory cytokines and complement genes by RPE cells were determined by real-time RT-PCR. The protein expression of CFB, C3, C1INH, and C1r was examined by Western blot. Our results show that un-stimulated RPE cells express a variety of complement-related genes, and that the expression levels of complement regulators, including C1r, factor H (CFH), DAF1, CD59, C1INH, Crry, and C4BP genes are significantly higher than those of complement component genes (C2, C4, CFB, C3, and C5). Macrophage supernatants increased inflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS), chemokine (CCL2) and complement expression in RPE cells. The supernatants from M0, M2a and M2c macrophages mildly up-regulated (2-3.5-fold) CFB, CFH and C3 gene expression in RPE cells, whereas the supernatants from M1 and M2b macrophages massively increased (10-30-fold) CFB and C3 gene expression in RPE cells. The expression of other genes, including C1r, C2, C4, CFH, Masp1, C1INH, and C4BP in RPE cells was also increased by the supernatants of M1 and M2b macrophages; however, the increment levels were significantly lower than CFB and C3 genes. M1 and M2b macrophage supernatants enhanced CFB (Bb fragment) protein expression and C3 secretion by RPE cells. M1 macrophages may affect complement expression in RPE cells through the STAT1 pathway.

Apart from impairment of immunity against microorganisms, it is known that hereditary deficiencies of this system predispose one to autoimmune conditions. Polymorphisms in complement genes are linked to, for example, atypical hemolytic uremia and age-dependent macular degeneration. The complement system comprises three convergent pathways of activation: the classical, the alternative, and the lectin pathway. The recently discovered lectin pathway is less studied, but polymorphisms in the plasma pattern-recognition molecule mannan-binding lectin (MBL) are known to impact its level, and\u00a0polymorphisms in the MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) result in defects of complement activation. Recent studies have described roles outside complement and immunity of another MBL-associated serine protease, MASP-3, in the etiology of 3MC syndrome, an autosomal-recessive disorder involving a spectrum of developmental features, including characteristic facial dysmorphism. Syndrome-causing mutations were identified in MASP1, encoding MASP-3 and two additional proteins, MASP-1 and MAp44. Furthermore, an association was discovered between 3MC syndrome and mutations in COLEC11, encoding CL-K1, another molecule of the lectin pathway. The findings were confirmed in zebrafish, indicating that MASP-3 and CL-K1 underlie an evolutionarily conserved pathway of embryonic development.

Recent studies have identified a loss-of-function allele at the HMX1 locus as the causative mutation in the oculo-auricular syndrome (OAS) in humans, characterized by ear and eye malformations. The mouse dumbo (dmbo) mutation, with similar effects on ear and eye development, also results from a loss-of-function mutation in the Hmx1 gene. A recessive dmbo mutation causing ear malformation in rats has been mapped to the chromosomal region containing the Hmx1 gene, but the nature of the causative allele is unknown. Here we show that dumbo rats and mice exhibit similar neonatal ear and eye phenotypes. In midgestation embryos, dumbo rats show a specific loss of Hmx1 expression in neural-crest-derived craniofacial mesenchyme (CM), whereas Hmx1 is expressed normally in retinal progenitors, sensory ganglia and in CM, which is derived from mesoderm. High-throughput resequencing of 1 Mb of rat chromosome 14 from dmbo/dmbo rats, encompassing the Hmx1 locus, reveals numerous divergences from the rat genomic reference sequence, but no coding changes in Hmx1. Fine genetic mapping narrows the dmbo critical region to an interval of \u223c410 kb immediately downstream of the Hmx1 transcription unit. Further sequence analysis of this region reveals a 5777-bp deletion located \u223c80 kb downstream in dmbo/dmbo rats that is not apparent in 137 other rat strains. The dmbo deletion region contains a highly conserved domain of \u223c500 bp, which is a candidate distal enhancer and which exhibits a similar relationship to Hmx genes in all vertebrate species for which data are available. We conclude that the rat dumbo phenotype is likely to result from loss of function of an ultraconserved enhancer specifically regulating Hmx1 expression in neural-crest-derived CM.

In this work, we identify the centrosomal protein NINL as a physical interaction partner of CC2D2A. NINL partially co-localizes with CC2D2A at the base of cilia and ninl knockdown in zebrafish leads to photoreceptor outer segment loss, mislocalization of opsins and vesicle accumulation, similar to cc2d2a-/- phenotypes. Moreover, partial ninl knockdown in cc2d2a-/- embryos enhances the retinal phenotype of the mutants, indicating a genetic interaction in vivo, for which an illustration is found in patients from a Joubert Syndrome cohort. Similar to zebrafish cc2d2a mutants, ninl morphants display altered Rab8a localization. Further exploration of the NINL-associated interactome identifies MICAL3, a protein known to interact with Rab8 and to play an important role in vesicle docking and fusion. Together, these data support a model where CC2D2A associates with NINL to provide a docking point for cilia-directed cargo vesicles, suggesting a mechanism by which transition zone proteins can control the protein content of the ciliary compartment.", "score": 1, "id": "26485645", "title": "The Ciliopathy Protein CC2D2A Associates with NINL and Functions in RAB8-MICAL3-Regulated Vesicle Trafficking."}, {"abstract": "Ciliopathies are Mendelian disorders caused by dysfunction of cilia, ubiquitous organelles involved in fluid propulsion (motile cilia) or signal transduction (primary cilia). Retinal dystrophy is a common phenotypic characteristic of ciliopathies since photoreceptor outer segments are specialized primary cilia. These ciliary structures heavily rely on intracellular minus-end directed transport of cargo, mediated at least in part by the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex, for their formation, maintenance and function. Ninein-like protein (NINL) is known to associate with this motor complex and is an important interaction partner of the ciliopathy-associated proteins lebercilin, USH2A and CC2D2A. Here, we scrutinize the function of NINL with combined proteomic and zebrafish in vivo approaches. We identify Double Zinc Ribbon and Ankyrin Repeat domains 1 (DZANK1) as a novel interaction partner of NINL and show that loss of Ninl, Dzank1 or both synergistically leads to dysmorphic photoreceptor outer segments, accumulation of trans-Golgi-derived vesicles and mislocalization of Rhodopsin and Ush2a in zebrafish. In addition, retrograde melanosome transport is severely impaired in zebrafish lacking Ninl or Dzank1. We further demonstrate that NINL and DZANK1 are essential for intracellular dynein-based transport by associating with complementary subunits of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex, thus shedding light on the structure and stoichiometry of this important motor complex. Altogether, our results support a model in which the NINL-DZANK1 protein module is involved in the proper assembly and folding of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex in photoreceptor cells, a process essential for outer segment formation and function.", "score": 1, "id": "26485514", "title": "NINL and DZANK1 Co-function in Vesicle Transport and Are Essential for Photoreceptor Development in Zebrafish."}, {"abstract": "Joubert syndrome is a multisystem disorder that is associated with a constellation of cyclic ocular motor disturbances.

Retinal dystrophy, cystic kidney disease, liver fibrosis and polydactyly are variably present, resulting in significant phenotypic heterogeneity and overlap with other ciliopathies. JS is also genetically heterogeneous, resulting from mutations in 13 genes. These factors render clinical/molecular diagnosis and management challenging. CC2D2A mutations are a relatively common cause of JS and also cause Meckel syndrome. The clinical consequences of CC2D2A mutations in patients with JS have been incompletely reported.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Subjects with JS from 209 families were evaluated to identify mutations in CC2D2A. Clinical and imaging features in subjects with CC2D2A mutations were compared with those in subjects without CC2D2A mutations and reports in the literature.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>10 novel CC2D2A mutations in 20 subjects were identified; a summary is provided of all published CC2D2A mutations. Subjects with CC2D2A-related JS were more likely to have ventriculomegaly (p<0.0001) and seizures (p=0.024) than subjects without CC2D2A mutations. No mutation-specific genotype-phenotype correlations could be identified, but the findings confirm the observation that mutations that cause CC2D2A-related JS are predicted to be less deleterious than mutations that cause CC2D2A-related Meckel syndrome. Missense variants in the coiled-coil and C2 domains, as well as the C-terminal region, identify these regions as important for the biological mechanisms underlying JS.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>CC2D2A testing should be prioritised in patients with JS and ventriculomegaly and/or seizures.

Hypotonia. Developmental delays. Often these findings are accompanied by episodic tachypnea or apnea and/or atypical eye movements. In general, the breathing abnormalities improve with age, truncal ataxia develops over time, and acquisition of gross motor milestones is delayed. Cognitive abilities are variable, ranging from severe intellectual disability to normal. The designation Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) is used to describe individuals with JS who have additional findings including retinal dystrophy, renal disease, ocular colobomas, occipital encephalocele, hepatic fibrosis, polydactyly, oral hamartomas, and endocrine abnormalities. Both intra- and interfamilial variation are seen.<br/><b>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: </b>The diagnosis of JSRD is based on the presence of characteristic clinical features and magnetic resonance images (MRI) through the junction of the midbrain and pons (isthmus region) that resemble a molar tooth. To date biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the following 19 genes are identified in about 50% of individuals with a JSRD: NPHP1, CEP290, AHI1, TMEM67 (MKS3), RPGRIP1L, CC2D2A, ARL13B, INPP5E, OFD1, TMEM216, KIF7, TCTN1, TCTN2, TMEM237, CEP41, TMEM138, C5orf42, TMEM231, and TCTN3; the other genes in which mutation is causative are unknown. To date, no individuals with JSRD and biallelic pathogenic variants in TTC21B have been reported.<br/><b>MANAGEMENT: </b>Treatment of manifestations: Infants and children with abnormal breathing may require stimulatory medications (e.g., caffeine); supplemental oxygen; mechanical support; or tracheostomy in rare cases. Other interventions may include speech therapy for oromotor dysfunction; occupational and physical therapy; educational support, including special programs for the visually impaired; and feedings by gastrostomy tube. Surgery may be required for polydactyly and symptomatic ptosis and/or strabismus. Nephronophthisis, end-stage renal disease, liver failure and/or fibrosis are treated with standard approaches. Surveillance: Annual evaluations of growth, vision, and liver and kidney function; periodic neuropsychologic and developmental testing. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in those with renal impairment; hepatotoxic drugs in those with liver impairment.<br/><b>GENETIC COUNSELING: </b>JSRDs are predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. JSRD caused by mutation of OFD1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. Digenic inheritance has been reported. For autosomal recessive inheritance: at conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family.

While P-glycoprotein, the product of the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene, is the most well-characterized ABC transporter, the pharmacological importance of a related transporter, ABCG2, is starting to be realized in veterinary medicine. Based primarily on human and rodent studies, a number of clinically relevant, structurally and functionally unrelated drugs are substrates for ABCG2. ABCG2 is expressed by a variety of normal tissues including the intestines, renal tubular cells, brain and retinal capillary endothelial cells, biliary canalicular cells, and others, where it functions to actively extrude substrate drugs. In this capacity, ABCG2 limits oral absorption of substrate drugs and restricts their distribution to privileged sites such as the brain and retina. ABCG2 is also expressed by tumor cells where it functions to limit the intracellular accumulation of cytotoxic agents, contributing to multidrug resistance. Several ABCG2 polymorphisms have been described in human patients, some of which result in altered drug disposition, increasing susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. Additionally, ABCG2 polymorphisms in humans have been associated with disease states such as gout. Feline ABCG2 has recently been demonstrated to have several amino acid differences at conserved sites compared with 10 other mammalian species. These amino acid differences adversely affect transport function of feline ABCG2 relative to that of human ABCG2. Furthermore, these differences appear to be responsible for fluoroquinolone-induced retinal toxicity in cats and may play a role in acetaminophen toxicity as well. Studies in rodents and sheep have determined that ABCG2 expressed in mammary tissue is responsible for the secretion of many compounds (both therapeutic and toxic) into milk.

The visual prognosis for children with BBS is poor. Night blindness is usually evident by age seven to eight years; the mean age of legal blindness is 15.5 years. Birth weight is usually normal, but significant weight gain begins within the first year and becomes a lifelong issue for most individuals. A majority of individuals have significant learning difficulties; a minority have severe impairment on IQ testing.

Obesity is managed with diet, exercise, and behavioral therapies; hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus are treated as in the general population. Early intervention and special education address cognitive disability; speech therapy for speech delay/impairment. Renal anomalies and hypertension are treated as in the general population; renal transplantation has been successful. Hydrocolpos, vaginal atresia, or hypospadias may be surgically corrected. Hormone replacement therapy for hypogonadism. Cardiac abnormalities are treated as in the general population. Surgery to remove accessory digits prevents functional interference and poor fitting of footwear. Prevention of secondary complications: Antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical and dental procedures is indicated for individuals with structural cardiac anomalies. Surveillance: Regular ophthalmologic evaluation, monitoring of renal function, endocrine and lipid profile, and annual blood pressure measurement. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Any substances contraindicated in persons with renal impairment. Pregnancy management: Expectant mothers affected with BBS require close monitoring for any deterioration in renal function or pregnancy-related complications due to structural abnormalities of the reproductive tract.<br/><b>GENETIC COUNSELING: </b>BBS is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Both interfamilial and intrafamilial phenotypic variability exists. In some families, pathogenic variants in more than one BBS locus may result in a clinical phenotype of BBS. However, such families are difficult to identify and by previous estimations may account for less than 10% of all BBS. It is thus prudent to use the following autosomal recessive risk figures when providing genetic counseling: at conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing is possible if the pathogenic variants in a family are known. Prenatal diagnosis using second-trimester ultrasound examination to detect anomalies associated with BBS such as postaxial polydactyly and renal cysts has been reported. If the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible through laboratories offering testing for the gene of interest.

Moreover, BBS protein complex formation is preserved in the Pk2-deficient (Pk2(-/-)) mouse. Previously we reported an intracellular melanosome transport delay as a cardinal feature of reduced bbs gene activity. We find that pk2 knockdown suppresses bbs7-related retrograde transport delay. Similarly, knockdown of ift22, an anterograde intraflagellar transport component, also suppresses the bbs7-related retrograde delay.

The Xc- transporter does not appear to be located within the ribbon synapse of the inner plexiform layer. Developmentally, the evolution of distinct ribbon-shaped Xc- labelling in the outer plexiform layer parallels the known morphological and electrophysiological maturation of photoreceptors. Using the cation channel probe agmatine, we tracked cation fluxes within bipolar cells and therefore indirectly determined the modulation of glutamate release from photoreceptors. Such cystine-driven alteration in agmatine entry into bipolar cells can be modified by a specific metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 antagonist [(RS)-alpha-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine] and an Xc- transport inhibitor [(S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine]. The phylogenetic preservation of the transporter, its ultrastructural localization to the ribbon synapse and functional modulation of post-receptoral neurons collectively support a role for the Xc- transporter in glutamate neurotransmission in the outer retina of vertebrates.

study characterizes the kallikrein-kinin system in vitreous from individuals with diabetic macular edema (DME) and examines mechanisms contributing to retinal thickening and retinal vascular permeability (RVP). Plasma prekallikrein (PPK) and plasma kallikrein (PKal) were increased twofold and 11.0-fold (both P < 0.0001), respectively, in vitreous from subjects with DME compared with those with a macular hole (MH). While the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was also increased in DME vitreous, PKal and VEGF concentrations do not correlate (r = 0.266, P = 0.112). Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified 167 vitreous proteins, including 30 that were increased in DME (fourfold or more, P < 0.001 vs. MH). The majority of proteins associated with DME displayed a higher correlation with PPK than with VEGF concentrations. DME vitreous containing relatively high levels of PKal and low VEGF induced RVP when injected into the vitreous of diabetic rats, a response blocked by bradykinin receptor antagonism but not by bevacizumab. Bradykinin-induced retinal thickening in mice was not affected by blockade of VEGF receptor 2. Diabetes-induced RVP was decreased by up to 78% (P < 0.001) in Klkb1 (PPK)-deficient mice compared with wild-type controls. B2- and B1 receptor-induced RVP in diabetic mice was blocked by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and inducible NOS deficiency, respectively. These findings implicate the PKal pathway as a VEGF-independent mediator of DME.", "score": 6, "id": "25979073", "title": "Plasma Kallikrein-Kinin System as a VEGF-Independent Mediator of Diabetic

Differentially expressed clones were sequenced and analyzed. One of these clones was a short transcript of NORPEG which we proceeded to analyze by RT-PCR.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>The novel short alternative transcript of NORPEG was isolated and named sNORPEG.

Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the sNORPEG protein contains six ankyrin repeats and two coiled-coil domains. It shares a high homology with the NORPEG and ankycorbin proteins in both its sequence and motifs. Blasting the human genome database localized sNORPEG to human chromosome 5p13.2-13.3. Expression profiles showed that sNORPEG was expressed in human fetal testes, adult testes and spermatozoa.

</b>Classic Joubert syndrome is characterized by three primary findings: A distinctive cerebellar and brain stem malformation called the molar tooth sign (MTS). Hypotonia. Developmental delays. Often these findings are accompanied by episodic tachypnea or apnea and/or atypical eye movements. In general, the breathing abnormalities improve with age, truncal ataxia develops over time, and acquisition of gross motor milestones is delayed. Cognitive abilities are variable, ranging from severe intellectual disability to normal. The designation Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) is used to describe individuals with JS who have additional findings including retinal dystrophy, renal disease, ocular colobomas, occipital encephalocele, hepatic fibrosis, polydactyly, oral hamartomas, and endocrine abnormalities. Both intra- and interfamilial variation are seen.<br/><b>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: </b>The diagnosis of JSRD is based on the presence of characteristic clinical features and magnetic resonance images (MRI) through the junction of the midbrain and pons (isthmus region) that resemble a molar tooth. To date biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the following 19 genes are identified in about 50% of individuals with a JSRD: NPHP1, CEP290, AHI1, TMEM67 (MKS3), RPGRIP1L, CC2D2A, ARL13B, INPP5E, OFD1, TMEM216, KIF7, TCTN1, TCTN2, TMEM237, CEP41, TMEM138, C5orf42, TMEM231, and TCTN3; the other genes in which mutation is causative are unknown. To date, no individuals with JSRD and biallelic pathogenic variants in TTC21B have been reported.<br/><b>MANAGEMENT: </b>Treatment of manifestations: Infants and children with abnormal breathing may require stimulatory medications (e.g., caffeine); supplemental oxygen; mechanical support; or tracheostomy in rare cases. Other interventions may include speech therapy for oromotor dysfunction; occupational and physical therapy; educational support, including special programs for the visually impaired; and feedings by gastrostomy tube. Surgery may be required for polydactyly and symptomatic ptosis and/or strabismus. Nephronophthisis, end-stage renal disease, liver failure and/or fibrosis are treated with standard approaches. Surveillance: Annual evaluations of growth, vision, and liver and kidney function; periodic neuropsychologic and developmental testing. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in those with renal impairment; hepatotoxic drugs in those with liver impairment.<br/><b>GENETIC COUNSELING: </b>JSRDs are predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. JSRD caused by mutation of OFD1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. Digenic inheritance has been reported. For autosomal recessive inheritance: at conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family. For pregnancies at known increased risk for Joubert syndrome prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound examination with or without fetal MRI has been successful.<br/>", "score": 1, "id": "20301500", "title":

[{"abstract": "Autophagy has been shown to be activated in neuronal cells in response to injury and suggested to have a cell-protective role in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the activation of autophagy in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve transection (ONT) and evaluated its effect on RGC survival. Expression of several autophagy-related genes, including Atg5, Atg7, and Atg12, and autophagy markers microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and beclin-1 were analyzed at the transcriptional or protein level 1, 3, and 7 days after ONT. Transcription of the Atg5, Atg7, and Atg12 genes was up-regulated 1.5- to 1.8-fold in the retina 3 days after ONT compared with that in the controls. Expression of Atg12 mRNA was increased 1.6-fold 1 day after ONT. Seven days after ONT, expression of Atg5, Atg7, and Atg12 mRNA was comparable to that in the untreated retinas. Western blot analysis of proteins isolated from RGCs showed 1.6-, 2.7-, and 1.7-fold increases in LC3-II level 1, 3, and 7 days after ONT, respectively, compared with those in the controls. Expression of beclin-1 was 1.7-fold higher 1 day after RGCs were axotomized, but 3 and 7 days after ONT it was comparable to that of the control. Inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1, 3-methyladenine, and Wortmannin in RGC-5 cells under serum-deprived conditions decreased cell viability by approximately 40%. These results suggest possible activation of autophagy in RGCs after optic nerve transection and demonstrate its protective role in RGC-5 cells maintained under conditions of serum deprivation.", "score": 3, "id": "18521932", "title": "Activation of autophagy in retinal ganglion cells."}, {"abstract": "We have explored the mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced mitochondrial dynamics disruption and mitophagy. Ethanol increases mitochondrial fission in a concentration-dependent manner through Drp1 mitochondrial translocation and OPA1 proteolytic cleavage. ARPE-19 (a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line) cells challenged with ethanol showed mitochondrial potential disruptions mediated by alterations in mitochondrial complex IV protein level and increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. In addition, ethanol activated the canonical autophagic pathway, as denoted by autophagosome formation and autophagy regulator elements including Beclin1, ATG5-ATG12 and P-S6 kinase. Likewise, autophagy inhibition dramatically increased mitochondrial fission and cell death, whereas autophagy stimulation rendered the opposite results, placing autophagy as a cytoprotective response aimed to remove damaged mitochondria. Interestingly, although ethanol induced mitochondrial Bax translocation, this episode was associated to cell death rather than mitochondrial fission or autophagy responses. Thus, Bax required 600 mM ethanol to migrate to mitochondria, a concentration that resulted in cell death. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking this protein respond to ethanol by undergoing mitochondrial fission and autophagy but not cytotoxicity. Finally, by using the specific mitochondrial-targeted scavenger MitoQ, we revealed mitochondria as the main source of reactive oxygen species that trigger autophagy activation. These findings suggest that cells respond to ethanol activating mitochondrial fission machinery by Drp1 and OPA1 rather than bax, in a manner that stimulates cytoprotective autophagy through mitochondrial ROS.", "score": 1, "id": "25779081", "title": "On the mechanism underlying ethanol-induced mitochondrial dynamic disruption and autophagy response."}]}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "P",

The diagnosis of gelatinous drop-like dystrophy and lattice corneal dystrophy I was confirmed by molecular genetic analysis of TACSTD2 and TGFBI, respectively.

Screening of TGFBI exons 4 and 12 in the proband did not reveal any allelic variants. However, screening of CHST6 in the proband demonstrated a novel homozygous missense mutation involving a highly conserved amino acid (c.518T > C; Leu173Pro) and undetectable serum AgKS levels in the proband confirmed the diagnosis of type I MCDC1. Quantitative PCR confirmed that both copies of CHST6 were present in the patient, excluding the possibility that the mutation was present in the hemizygous state. The results of genotyping were consistent with maternal isodisomy, as the patient was homozygous for an allele possessed by his mother at each SNP, two of which were informative and demonstrated nonpaternal inheritance.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>A phenotypically unusual variant of MCDC1 was found to be associated with the novel Leu173Pro mutation in CHST6, transmitted via uniparental isodisomy, a previously unreported pattern of inheritance in the corneal dystrophies.<br/>", "score": 2, "id": "17896316", "title": "An unusual presentation of macular corneal dystrophy associated with uniparental isodisomy and a novel Leu173Pro mutation."}, {"abstract": "<b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To investigate in vivo laser confocal microscopic findings of genetically mapped corneal stromal dystrophies and their relationship to histopathologic findings.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Seven patients with Avellino corneal dystrophy, 2 patients with lattice corneal dystrophy, and 2 patients with macular corneal dystrophy were examined genetically and using slitlamp biomicroscopy and in vivo laser confocal microscopy.

The designation is imprecise but remains in vogue because of its clinical value. Clinically, the corneal dystrophies can be divided into three groups based on the sole or predominant anatomical location of the abnormalities. Some affect primarily the corneal epithelium and its basement membrane or Bowman layer and the superficial corneal stroma (anterior corneal dystrophies), the corneal stroma (stromal corneal dystrophies), or Descemet membrane and the corneal endothelium (posterior corneal dystrophies). Most corneal dystrophies have no systemic manifestations and present with variable shaped corneal opacities in a clear or cloudy cornea and they affect visual acuity to different degrees. Corneal dystrophies may have a simple autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive Mendelian mode of inheritance. Different corneal dystrophies are caused by mutations in the CHST6, KRT3, KRT12, PIP5K3, SLC4A11, TACSTD2, TGFBI, and UBIAD1 genes. Knowledge about the responsible genetic mutations responsible for these disorders has led to a better understanding of their basic defect and to molecular tests for their precise diagnosis. Genes for other corneal dystrophies have been mapped to specific chromosomal loci, but have not yet been identified. As clinical manifestations widely vary with the different entities, corneal dystrophies should be suspected when corneal transparency is lost or corneal opacities occur spontaneously, particularly in both corneas, and especially in the presence of a positive family history or in the offspring of consanguineous parents. Main differential diagnoses include various causes of monoclonal gammopathy, lecithin-cholesterol-acyltransferase deficiency, Fabry disease, cystinosis, tyrosine transaminase deficiency, systemic lysosomal storage diseases (mucopolysaccharidoses, lipidoses, mucolipidoses), and several skin diseases (X-linked ichthyosis, keratosis follicularis spinolosa decalvans).

Corneal transplantation is performed to restore vision of patients with corneal disorders, but the condition of the donor corneal endothelium is the key to maintaining transparency of the grafted cornea. We investigated the function or cell cycle mechanism of corneal endothelium at the level of the gene, and we also studied induced genes of endothelial cells during preservation of donor corneas. 1.

The incidence of patients was estimated to be 12.4 x 10(-5) for males and 6.7 x 10(-5) for females. The male/female ratio was 1.7: 1.0. The number of male patients was low when compared with studies reported 17 years ago. Rupture of Descemet's membrane in males was significantly higher than in females.

Formation of advanced glycation endoproducts (AGEs) is increased in diabetes and contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. CD74 is increased in activated microglia in a rat model developing both neurodegeneration and vasoregression. In this study, we aimed at investigating whether glucose and major AGE precursor methylglyoxal induce increased CD74 expression in the retina. Expression of CD74 in retinal microglia was analyzed in streptozotocin-diabetic rats by wholemount immunofluorescence. Nondiabetic mice were intravitreally injected with methylglyoxal. Expression of CD74 was studied by retinal wholemount immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time PCR, 48\u00a0h after the injection. CD74-positive cells were increased in diabetic 4-month retinas. These cells represented a subpopulation of CD11b-labeled activated microglia and were mainly located in the superficial vascular layer (13.7-fold increase compared to nondiabetic group). Methylglyoxal induced an 9.4-fold increase of CD74-positive cells in the superficial vascular layer and elevated gene expression of CD74 in the mouse retina 2.8-fold. In summary, we identified CD74 as a microglial activation marker in the diabetic retina. Exogenous methylglyoxal mimics the response in normoglycemic retina. This suggests that methylglyoxal is important in mediating microglial activation in the diabetic retina.", "score": 9, "id": "24974304", "title": "CD74 indicates microglial activation in experimental diabetic retinopathy and exogenous methylglyoxal mimics the response in normoglycemic retina."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>Innate immunity plays a role in many diseases, including glaucoma and AMD. We have used transcriptome profiling in the mouse to identify a network of genes involved in innate immunity that is present in the normal retina and that is activated by optic nerve crush (ONC).<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Using a recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strain set (BXD, C57BL/6 crossed with DBA/2J mice), we generate expression datasets (Illumina WG 6.2 arrays) in the normal mouse retina and 2 days after ONC. The normal dataset is constructed from retinas from 80 mouse strains and the ONC dataset is constructed from 62 strains. These large datasets are hosted by GeneNetwork.org, along with a series of powerful bioinformatic tools.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>In the retina datasets, one intriguing network involves transcripts associated with the innate immunity. Using C4b to interrogate the normal dataset, we can identify a group of genes that are coregulated across the BXD RI strains. Many of the genes in this network are associated with the innate immune system, including Serping1, Casp1, C3, Icam1, Tgfbr2, Cfi, Clu, C1qg, Aif1, and Cd74. Following ONC, the expression of these genes is upregulated, along with an increase in coordinated expression across the BXD strains. Many of the genes in this network are risk factors for AMD, including C3, EFEMP1, MCDR2, CFB, TLR4, HTA1, and C1QTNF5.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>We found a retina-intrinsic innate immunity network that is activated by injury including ONC.

We have recently characterized a rat ciliopathy model which develops primary photoreceptor degeneration and secondary vasoregression. To improve the understanding of secondary vasoregression in retinal neurodegeneration, we used microarray techniques to compare gene expression profiles in this new model before and after retinal vasoregression. Differential gene expression was validated by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. Of the 157 genes regulated more than twofold, the MHC class II invariant chain CD74 yielded the strongest upregulation, and was allocated to activated microglial cells close to the vessels undergoing vasoregression. Pathway clustering identified genes of the immune system including inflammatory signaling, and components of the complement cascade upregulated during vasoregression.

To target the whole neuroglialvascular unit, neuro- and vasoprotective Erythropoietin (EPO) was intraperitoneally injected into four-week old male heterozygous PKD rats three times a week at a dose of 256 IU/kg body weight. For comparison EPO-like peptide, lacking unwanted side effects of EPO treatment, was given five times a week at a dose of 10 \u00b5g/kg body weight. Matched EPO treated Sprague Dawley and water-injected PKD rats were held as controls. After four weeks of treatment the animals were sacrificed and analysis of the neurovascular morphology, glial cell activity and pAkt localization was performed. The number of endothelial cells and pericytes did not change after treatment with EPO or EPO-like peptide. There was a nonsignificant reduction of migrating pericytes by 23% and 49%, respectively. Formation of acellular capillaries was significantly reduced by 49% (p<0.001) or 40% (p<0.05). EPO-treatment protected against thinning of the central retina by 10% (p<0.05), a composite of an increase of the outer nuclear layer by 12% (p<0.01) and in the outer segments of photoreceptors by 26% (p<0.001). Quantification of cell nuclei revealed no difference. Microglial activity, shown by gene expression of CD74, decreased by 67% (p<0.01) after EPO and 36% (n.s.) after EPO-like peptide treatment.

\u03b1\u2081-adrenoceptor subtype(s) involved in the noradrenaline-induced contraction of retinal arterioles in rats. In vivo ocular fundus images were captured with a digital camera equipped with a special objective lens. By measuring changes in diameter of retinal arterioles in the fundus images, retinal vascular response was assessed. The systemic blood pressure and heart rate in the animals were also continuously recorded. Following blockade of \u03b2\u2081/\u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptors with propranolol, noradrenaline (0.03-3 \u03bcg/kg/min, i.v.) decreased the diameter of retinal arterioles and increased the mean blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The highest dose (3 \u03bcg/kg/min, i.v.) of noradrenaline caused a small increase in heart rate. The \u03b1(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist RS100329 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) and the \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY 7378 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly prevented noradrenaline-induced contraction of retinal arterioles and pressor responses whereas the \u03b1(1B)-adrenoceptor antagonist L-765314 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not. The \u03b1(1A)-adrenoceptor agonist, A 61603 (0.03-0.3 \u03bcg/kg/min, i.v.), also caused contractile responses of retinal arterioles and pressor responses. These responses were almost completely prevented by RS100329 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), but not by BMY 7378 (1 mg/kg, i.v.). These results suggest that the contractile effects of noradrenaline on retinal arterioles and peripheral resistance vessels are, at least in part, mediated by stimulation of \u03b1(1A)- and \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptors.

In normal rabbit eyes, topically instilled bunazosin hydrochloride reached the posterior retina by local penetration at concentrations sufficient to attenuate the phenylephrine- or endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced constriction of retinal arteries. Furthermore, bunazosin hydrochloride improved the impairment of optic nerve head (ONH) blood flow, the prolongation of visual-evoked potentials (VEP) implicit time, the enlargement of the optic disk cup, and the decrease in the number of retinal ganglion cell layer cells induced by repeated injections of ET-1 in rabbits. Topically instilled bunazosin hydrochloride improved the reductions in ONH capillary blood flow and VEP amplitude induced in rabbit eyes by nitric oxide synthase inhibition. In rat primary retinal cultures, bunazosin hydrochloride reduced glutamate-induced neuronal cell death, presumably through a Na+ channel blocking effect. In healthy humans, topically instilled bunazosin hydrochloride reportedly increases blood velocity in the ONH, retina and choroid, without significantly altering either blood pressure or heart rate.

Color fundus photographs were taken at 5 minutes before and 60 minutes after the injection. The average diameter of the major retinal arteries at the rim of the optic nerve head (ONH) was normalized with respect to ONH diameter.

To examine any interaction between the alpha1-adrenoceptor and ET receptor, phenylephrine and ET-1 were co-injected at individually ineffective doses.

Apomorphine did not affect NAT activity or melatonin content of the pineal gland. In contrast, clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, inhibited the nocturnal rise in pineal NAT activity and melatonin content although being without effect on these parameters in retina. Apomorphine-induced inhibition of retinal NAT activity was blocked by spiperone, a D2-dopamine receptor antagonist, but not by antagonists of D1-dopamine, alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta adrenergic receptors. Systemic or intraocular injection of quinpirole, a D2-dopamine receptor agonist, in the middle of the dark phase of the light-dark cycle markedly reduced retinal NAT activity and melatonin level, whereas injections of SKF 38393-A, a D1-dopaminergic agonist, had no effect. The inhibitory effect of clonidine on pineal NAT activity was blocked by yohimbine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that NAT activity and melatonin content in chicken retina and pineal gland are differentially modulated in vivo by D2-dopamine and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, respectively.

Here we show that an anti-glaucoma drug, nipradilol, at low concentration led to a four-fold increase in the number of cat retinal ganglion cells regenerating their axons into a transplanted peripheral nerve 4 and 6 weeks after axotomy. Nipradilol also increased the number of three main regenerating retinal ganglion cell types (alpha, beta, not alpha/beta), and enhanced the rate of axonal regeneration of these retinal ganglion cells. Nipradilol is a donor of nitric oxide and an antagonist of alpha-1, beta-1 and -2 adrenoreceptors, and we therefore examined whether one of these pharmacological effects might be more important in promoting axon regeneration. A nitric oxide donor increased the number of regenerating retinal ganglion cells, but not the rate of axonal regeneration. Denitro-nipradilol (nitric oxide-deprived nipradilol) or a nitric oxide scavenger injected before nipradilol increased the number of regenerating retinal ganglion cells but did not promote regeneration rate.

In vitro experiments in a microvascular myograph were designed in order to investigate the effects of human neuropeptide Y (NPY), its receptor subtype and the mechanisms underlying NPY actions in bovine isolated retinal proximal (PRA) and distal (DRA) arteries. 2. A single concentration of NPY (10 nM) induced a prompt and reproducible contraction which reached a plateau within 1-4 min, after which the response returned to baseline over the next 2-10 min. Cumulative addition of NPY induced concentration-dependent contractions of bovine retinal arteries, with an EC50[M] of 1.7 nM and a maximal response equal to 54 +/- 8% of Emax (absolute maximal contractile levels of vessels) and not different from that obtained by a single addition of the peptide. There were no significant differences in either sensitivity or maximal response to NPY between PRA and DRA. 3. Porcine NPY and the selective Y1-receptor agonist, [Pro34]NPY, also induced concentration-dependent contractions of the retinal arteries with a potency and maximal response not significantly different from those of human NPY; in contrast, the selective Y2-receptor agonist, NPY(13-36), caused only a 5% contraction at the highest concentration used. 4. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or pretreatment with the 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca(2+)-channel blocker, nifedipine (1 microM), reduced the contractile response of 10 nM NPY to 18.4 +/- 3.3% (n = 6) and 18.6 +/- 3.9% (n = 6); respectively, of the controls. 5. Mechanical removal of the endothelium depressed the maximal contraction elicited by NPY in PRA but did not affect either sensitivity or maximal response to the peptide in DRA. In endothelium-intact arteries, blockade of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway with 3 microM indomethacin increased resting tension in both PRA and DRA and significantly inhibited sensitivity and maximal contraction to NPY of PRA and DRA, respectively. The thromboxane A2 (TXA2)/prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) receptor antagonist, SQ30741, reduced both sensitivity and maximal contraction to NPY in PRA but not in DRA. 6. In endothelium-denuded PRA, indomethacin but not SQ30741 significantly reduced NPY maximal response and induced a marked increase in resting tension suggesting a basal release of a vasodilator prostanoid from smooth muscle cells. 7. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (150 u ml-1) reduced the maximal contraction to NPY in PRA. Inhibition of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase with NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) (30 microM), enhanced sensitivity and maximal contraction to NPY in both PRA and DRA. In the presence of L-NOARG, SOD did not further inhibit NPY responses in PRA. 8. NPY (10 nM) induced a 2.9 fold leftwards shift of the noradrenaline concentration-response curves in PRA and increased maximal response by 50 +/- 16%. Neither 1 nor 10 nM NPY affected noradrenaline responses in DRA. [Pro34]NPY (10 nM), but not NPY(13-36), mimicked the potentiating effect of NPY on noradrenaline responses in PRA. 9. TXA2 analogue, U46619, at 10 nM elicited 3.6 fold leftwards shift of the noradrenaline concentration-responses curves in PRA and increased the maximal contraction by 32 +/- 3%, whereas in the presence of 1 microM SQ30741, 10 nM NPY did not potentiate noradrenaline responses. 10. The present results indicate that NPY may play a role in the regulation of retinal blood flow through both a direct contractile action, independent of the vessel size and a potentiation of the responses induced by noradrenaline in the proximal part of the retinal circulation, both effects being mediated by Y1 receptors. NPY promotes Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and stimulates the synthesis of contractile prostanoids in PRA and DRA, although only in PRA does the peptide trigger the release of an endothelium-derived contractile factor which facilitates the contraction and also seems to account for the potentiating effect of NPY.", "score": 6, "id": "8590997", "title": "Regional involvement of an endothelium-derived contractile factor in the vasoactive actions of neuropeptide Y in bovine isolated retinal arteries."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>To examine the localization of a novel alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype of alpha 1C receptor in the eye, we compared the amount of alpha 1C receptor transcripts in bovine retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in neural retina by employing reverse transcription of mRNA and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>RT-PCR assay with specific primers for the alpha 1C-adrenergic receptor and for beta-actin showed linear relationships between input quantity of RNA and the amount of amplified PCR products for the alpha 1C-adrenergic receptor and also for beta-actin, when PCR was conducted for 24 and 15 cycles, respectively.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>The RT-PCR assay demonstrated that the spontaneous expression level of the alpha 1C-adrenergic receptor mRNA was much higher in bovine RPE than in neural retina; the alpha 1C-adrenergic receptor/beta-actin ratio from RPE was 0.33 +/- 0.15 (n = 4), whereas that from neural retina was virtually zero.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The RT-PCR assay is a sensitive semiquantitative method for a low abundance mRNA in a limited number of cells.

Every neurotransmitter or neuromediator of the brain is present in defined neurones of the retina which is also part of the central nervous system. Nerves innervating the iris, ciliary processes, cornea, choroid and parts of the eye other than the neuronal retina belong to the peripheral nervous system. These nerves contain catecholamines, acetylcholine and a variety of neuropeptides. The receptor-types shown to exist in the retina, iris, ciliary processes, cornea and other areas of the eye are numerous. In some instances the presence of specific types of receptors is associated with nerves containing the natural ligand while in other instances this is not the case e.g. for serotonin in the iris/ciliary processes. Thus certain receptor-types in the eye may be specifically controlled by hormones or mediators released locally from non-neuronal cells such as glial cells or retinal pigment epithelial cells. Evidence that noradrenaline has a functional role in the retina comes most convincingly from the finding that beta, alpha 1 and alpha 2-type receptors are present. Binding studies and agonist-induced effects on the secondary messengers cAMP and inositol phosphates show the beta receptors to be positively coupled to adenylate cyclases whereas alpha 2 receptors are negatively coupled to the enzyme. Stimulation of alpha 1 receptors triggers the production of inositol phosphates. A number of recent studies have shown that endothelin (ET) is an important vasoactive ocular peptide. We have focussed on determining the nature of ET receptors in the front of the eye. Autoradiographic studies have shown that specific 125I-ET-1 binding sites are associated with the iris, ciliary processes and corneal endothelium. The ETs stimulated inositol phosphates accumulation and decreased the synthesis of cAMP in the iris/ciliary processes. Thus is would appear that at least two types of ET receptors are present.

In the latter experiments the EP-induced conductance changes were unaltered, indicating that EP increases basolateral membrane Cl conductance independent of voltage. The EP-induced change in basolateral Cl conductance was followed by a secondary decrease in apical membrane K conductance (approximately 50%) as measured by delta [K]o-induced diffusion potentials.

This study identifies ecto-5' nucleotidase on RPE cells and investigates modulation of enzyme activity. The RPE was the most active site of 5'AMP dephosphorylation in the posterior rat eye. The ecto-5' nucleotidase inhibitor alphabetamADP prevented the production adenosine by the apical membrane of the bovine RPE. Cultured human ARPE-19 cells expressed mRNA and protein for ecto-5' nucleotidase. The production of phosphate from 5'AMP by ARPE-19 cells was inhibited by alphabetamADP, but the ecto-alkaline phosphatase inhibitor levamisole had no effect. Degradation of 5'AMP was blocked by norepinephrine, epinephrine and phenylephrine, with inhibition by antagonists prazosin and corynanthine implicating the alpha1 adrenergic receptor. The block of enzyme activity by norepinephrine was rapid, occurring within 1 min, and was similar at both 4 and 37 degrees C, consistent with cleavage of the enzyme from its GPI anchor.

In the apical face of the bovine-RPE eyecup, norepinephrine reduced the production of phosphate from 5'AMP, suggesting that both receptor and enzyme face sub-retinal space. In conclusion, RPE cells express ecto-5' nucleotidase, with activity on the apical membrane, and stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors downregulates activity.

The spontaneous generation of high-frequency bursts of spikes in dLGN relay neurones, associated with periods of highly synchronized, delta-like patterns of the EEG, was selectively suppressed by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline or the alpha 1- adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Single action potentials, occurring at a low frequency between bursts, were significantly less affected. Depending upon the ejection level of the adrenoceptor agonists, burst activity was suppressed by 23-73%, compared with a reduction in single spike firing in the range 7-24%. The suppression of burst firing occurred in all functional types of dLGN relay neurones (X, Y; on, off), enhanced burst activity was observed in less than 1% of the cells. 3.

Their exact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood but a decreased perfusion pressure in the ciliary body due to blockade of vasodilatory beta-adrenoceptors is thought to participate in the reduction of intraocular pressure. This study investigates the vasodilator action of beta adrenergic-agents in intra- and extraocular arteries from bovine and human eyes. Ring segments of retinal, choroidal, intraocular segment of long posterior ciliary artery, and segments of extraocular posterior ciliary arteries from bovine eyes and short posterior ciliary arteries from freshly enucleated human eyes were mounted on an isometric myograph and their reactivity to beta-adrenergic drugs were studied. Of all vessel types examined only the intraocular segment of long posterior ciliary artery precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha responded to 1-isoprenaline (1 nM-1 microM) with a graded concentration-dependent relaxation (32 +/- 7%, n = 10) and a pD2 of 7.5 +/- 0.2 concentrations of 1-isoprenaline greater than 1 microM induced contractions which were antagonized by a combined blockade of alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptors. Salbutamol (selective beta2-agonist) induced relaxations of similar magnitude as that of 1-isoprenaline but the sensitivity of the intraocular segment of long posterior ciliary arteries to salbutamol was 312 times less than that to 1-isoprenaline, pD2 7.2 +/- 0.2 and 4.4 +/- 0.1 (n = 6), respectively, whereas dobutamine (selective beta 1-agonist) had no effect between 1 nM and 10 microM. Betaxolol (selective beta 1-antagonist) and 1CI 115811 (selective beta 2-antagonist) competitively antagonized isoprenaline-induced relaxations giving pKB-values of 5.9 +/- 0.1 (n = 11) and 8.5 +/- 0.1 (n = 6), respectively. The slope of the Schild-plots were equal to unity. Human posterior ciliary arteries with spontaneous tone or tone induced by 10 microM PGF2 alpha did not react to isoprenaline (1 nM-10 microM). The bovine intraocular segment of long posterior ciliary arteries contracted to 1-noradrenaline without alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and addition of propranolol or cocaine did not change the concentration-response curve. 1-Phenylephrine and B-HT933 induced both potent and strong contractions indicating the presence of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in these arteries. Although beta-adrenoceptors have been identified in various parts of the ocular circulation by radio-ligand binding techniques our data show that beta-adrenoceptors linked to regulation of vascular tone are only found in intraocular branches of the intraocular segment of long posterior ciliary artery in bovine eyes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "score": 1, "id": "7660314", "title": "Beta-adrenergic receptors regulating vascular smooth muscle tone are only localized to the intraocular segment of the long posterior ciliary artery in bovine eye."}, {"abstract": "A68930, (1R,3S)-1-aminomethyl-5,6-dihydroxy-3-phenylisochroman HCl, is a potent (EC50 = 2.5 nM), partial (intrinsic activity = 66% of dopamine) agonist in the fish retina dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase model of the D1 dopamine receptor. In the rat caudate-putamen model of the D1 dopamine receptor, A68930 is a potent (EC50 = 2.1 nM) full agonist. In contrast, A68930 is a much weaker (EC50 = 3920 nM) full agonist in a biochemical model of the dopamine D2 receptor. The orientation of the 3-phenyl substituent in the molecule is critical for the affinity and selectivity of the molecule towards the dopamine D1 receptor. A68930 also displays weak alpha 2-agonist activity but the molecule is virtually inactive at the alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors. When tested in rats bearing a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the nigro-neostriatal neurons, A68930 elicits prolonged (greater than 20 h) contralateral turning that is antagonized by dopamine D1 receptor selective doses of SCH 23390 but not by D2 receptor selective doses of haloperidol.

They provide highly specific reagents to membrane-associated proteins, such as pumps, channels, receptors, and cell-adhesion molecules, that are useful for purifying these proteins, studying their structures at high resolution, and mapping their distributions. In many cases, the specific reagents were obtained using only partially purified antigens. Monoclonal antibodies to cytoskeletal proteins, organelles, and protein kinases have revealed that specific molecules are concentrated in anatomically distinct regions of the cell. A protein kinase has been shown to be a major postsynaptic constituent in many synapses. Individual proteins, such as actin, tubulin, and calmodulin appear to have different antigenic epitopes shielded in different parts of the cell. Monoclonal antibodies have provided a diversity of cell-type-specific reagents in both vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. They seem likely to be useful in identifying functionally related subpopulations of neurons and describing neural cell lineages. They will also serve to identify molecules that are important in regulating cell migration in the cerebellum, in marking cell position in the retina, and directing axon growth. This review also documents many purposes for which monoclonal antibodies are poorly suited or must be used with caution: A monoclonal antibody to a protein does not always reveal every place where that molecule is located. Pre- or post-translational microheterogeneity can expose different epitopes on the protein, such as may occur on the Na+-channel. Other proteins within the cell may shield antigenic sites on proteins such as calmodulin. Monoclonal antibodies can bind to epitopes on unrelated molecules (Nigg et al 1982, Lane & Koprowski 1982). This is revealed in some cases as multiple bands on immunoblots. Some cross-reactivity, however, may have a functional basis. For example, structural homology is clearly the basis for the antigenic epitopes that are shared among the five classes of intermediate filaments (Pruss et al 1981). The epitope that appears to be shared between the muscarinic and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors may be conserved because the two receptors modulate common effectors. The cross-reactivity between these receptors was only recognized because very specific and sensitive assays exist for each. It is quite possible that these same antibodies also bind sites on many other types of receptors. Mapping the distribution of this epitope may therefore have little relationship to the actual distribution of the muscarinic receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "score": 1, "id": "2580471",

Pathogenesis of polyglutamine (poly(Q)) diseases involves increased protein misfolding, along with ubiquitin and chaperon protein-containing nuclear aggregates. In spinocerebellar ataxia, the brain and retina undergo degeneration. Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) is made on-demand in the nervous system and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in response to oxidative stress, which activates prosurvival signaling via regulation of gene expression and other processes. We hypothesized that protein misfolding-induced proteotoxic stress triggers NPD1 synthesis. We used ARPE-19 cells as a cellular model to assess stress due to ataxin-1 82Q protein expression and determine whether NPD1 prevents apoptosis. Ectopic ataxin-1 expression induced RPE cell apoptosis, which was abrogated by 100 nm docosahexaenoic acid, 10 ng/ml pigment epithelium-derived factor, or NPD1. Similarly, NPD1 was protective in neurons and primary human RPE cells. Furthermore, when ataxin-1 82Q was expressed in 15-lipoxygenase-1-deficient cells, apoptosis was greatly enhanced, and only NPD1 (50 nm) rescued cells from death. NPD1 reduced misfolded ataxin-1-induced accumulation of proapoptotic Bax in the cytoplasm, suggesting that NPD1 acts by preventing proapoptotic signaling pathways from occurring. Finally, NPD1 signaling interfered with ataxin-1/capicua repression of gene expression and decreased phosphorylated ataxin-1 in an Akt-independent manner, suggesting that NPD1 signaling modulates formation or stabilization of ataxin-1 complexes. These data suggest that 1) NPD1 synthesis is an early response induced by proteotoxic stress due to abnormally folded ataxin-1, and 2) NPD1 promotes cell survival through modulating stabilization of ataxin-1 functional complexes and pro-/antiapoptotic and inflammatory pathways.", "score": 2, "id": "22511762", "title": "Ataxin-1 poly(Q)-induced proteotoxic stress and apoptosis are attenuated in neural cells by docosahexaenoic acid-derived neuroprotectin D1."}, {"abstract": "We investigated the clinical features and gene mutation in a pedigree of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA).

However, no clear evidence of lymphatic vessels draining intraocular and orbital tissues--retina, choroid, sclera, and extraocular muscles--exists.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Ocular tissue flatmounts from normal or enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) chimeric mice were immunostained for lymphatic endothelium hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1, a routinely used lymphatic endothelial marker), podoplanin, Flt4/VEGFR3, Sca-1, CD11b, or F4/80 and were observed by confocal microscopy. Single-cell suspensions from ocular tissues were also prepared and were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Lymphatic vessels were detected in the posterior regions of the extraocular muscles and the connective tissues of the extraocular muscle cones in the normal mouse. No typical lymphatic vessels were found within the eye. A large population of LYVE-1(+) nonendothelial cells, distributed as single cells, was detected in all ocular tissues except the central cornea. These cells also express another lymphatic endothelial cell marker, Flt4/VEGFR3, but not podoplanin, and they have hyaluronan-binding ability. Bone marrow chimerism studies indicated that the LYVE-1(+) cell populations are bone marrow derived and have a slow turnover in ocular tissues (3-6 months). Phenotype analysis revealed that nonendothelial LYVE-1(+)cells in the sclera, choroid, and iris included CD11b(+)F4/80(+) macrophages, CD11b(+)F4/80(-) macrophages, and CD11b(-)F4/80(-) bone marrow-derived cells. All LYVE-1(+) cells in the retina were CD11b(+)F4/80(+) macrophages. Cells in the limbus and the iris root also express Sca-1, suggesting that they are hematopoietic lymphatic vessel progenitor cells.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>These observations suggest that a lymphatic system exists for the transport of immune cells and fluids from the posterior segment of the eye, that ocular tissues are rich in bone marrow-derived LYVE-1(+) macrophages under normal physiological conditions, and that a subpopulation of these cells may represent resident precursor cells necessary for the de novo formation of ocular/orbital lymphatic vessels in pathologic conditions.<br/>", "score": 2, "id": "17460275", "title": "LYVE-1-positive macrophages are present in normal murine eyes."}, {"abstract": "Most human neurodegenerative diseases have a number of common features, including adult onset, progressive degeneration of selected neuronal populations and formation of abnormal protein aggregates. Although these shared characteristics raise the possibility of conserved pathogenic mechanisms, the diverse clinical and pathological features of each disorder indicate significant differences. As a number of human neurodegenerative diseases have now been modeled in Drosophila, and genetic modifiers identified, we have been able to perform a genetic comparison of pathways controlling toxicity in these models. By directly comparing modifiers isolated in the models of polyglutamine diseases and in a Drosophila model of tauopathy, we find a final common pathway of cell death involving apoptosis. Among the polyglutamine diseases, protein folding and histone acetylation are common key mediators. In addition, two novel modifiers suggest shared pathways of toxicity among all the disorders. Cell-type specificity is a salient feature of all neurodegenerative diseases; however, most work to date in the Drosophila models have been performed in the retina. Therefore, we determined whether similar pathways of toxicity operate in neurons of the Drosophila brain. Many, but not all, retinal modifiers also modify toxicity in postmitotic neurons in the brain. Analysis of polyglutamine toxicity in the adult brain facilitated the identification of nicotinamide (vitamin B3), a vitamin with histone deacetylase inhibiting activity, as a potent suppressor of polyglutamine toxicity. These findings outline common pathways of neurotoxicity, demonstrate disease- and cell-type specific pathways and identify a common vitamin as a potential therapy in polyglutamine disorders.", "score": 2, "id": "15254017", "title": "Comparison of pathways controlling toxicity in the eye and brain in Drosophila models of human neurodegenerative diseases."}, {"abstract": "", "score": 1, "id": "17043301", "title": "Pigmentary macular dystrophy in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1."}, {"abstract": "The dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders linked by progressive deterioration in balance and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3.

transduced through Frizzled (FZD) family receptor and LRP5/LRP6 co-receptor to upregulate MYC, CCND1, FGF20, JAG1, WISP1 and DKK1 genes, while non-canonical WNT signals are transduced through FZD family receptor and PTK7/ROR2/RYK co-receptor to activate RHOA/RHOU/RAC/CDC42, JNK, PKC, NFAT and NLK signaling cascades. FZD7, expressed in the normal gastrointestinal tract, is upregulated in esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 genes were identified and characterized by using bioinformatics (Techint) and human intelligence (Humint). Chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 genes were identified within NW_001232110.1 and AC173037.2 genome sequences, respectively. Chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 showed 100% and 97.2% total-amino-acid identity with human FZD7. All of the nine amino-acid residues substituted between human FZD7 and human FzE3 were identical to those of human FZD7 in chimpanzee, cow, mouse and rat FZD7 orthologs. Functional analyses using FzE3 with multiple cloning artifacts and/or sequencing errors are invalid. FZD7 orthologs were seven-transmembrane proteins with extracellular Frizzled domain, leucine zipper motif around the 5th transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic DVL- and PDZ-binding motifs. Ser550 and Ser556 of FZD7 orthologs were putative aPKC phosphorylation sites. Dimerization and Ser550/556 phosphorylation were predicted as regulatory mechanisms for the signaling through FZD7. Transcriptional start site of human FZD7 gene was 735-bp upstream of NM_003507.1 RefSeq 5'-end. In addition to gastrointestinal cancer, hepatocellular cancer and pancreatic cancer, human FZD7 mRNAs were expressed in blastocysts, undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells, ES-derived endodermal progenitors, ES-derived neural progenitors, fetal cochlea, retinal pigment epithelium, olfactory epithelium, regenerating liver, and multiple sclerosis. Comparative genomics analyses revealed that the binding sites for PU.1, SP1/Kr\u00fcppel-like, CCAAT-box, and TCF/LEF/SOX transcription factors were conserved among 5'-promoter regions of mammalian FZD7 orthologs.", "score": 1, "id": "17273804", "title": "Comparative integromics on FZD7 orthologs: conserved binding sites for PU.1, SP1, CCAAT-box and TCF/LEF/SOX transcription factors within

Principal cell monolayers with fully formed apical monocilia responded three- to fivefold greater to hypotonicity than mutant monolayers lacking monocilia. In support of the idea that monocilia are sensory organelles, intentionally harsh pipetting of medium directly onto the center of the monolayer induced ATP release in genetically rescued monolayers that possessed apical monocilia. Mechanical stimulation was much less effective, however, on mutant orpk collecting duct principal cell monolayers that lacked apical central monocilia. Our data also show that an increase in cytosolic free Ca(2+) primes the ATP pool that is released in response to mechanical stimuli. It also appears that hypotonic cell swelling and mechanical pipetting stimuli trigger release of a common ATP pool. Cilium-competent monolayers responded to flow with an increase in cell Ca(2+) derived from both extracellular and intracellular stores. This flow-induced Ca(2+) signal was less robust in cilium-deficient monolayers. Flow-induced Ca(2+) signals in both preparations were attenuated by extracellular gadolinium and by extracellular apyrase, an ATPase/ADPase. Taken together, these data suggest that apical monocilia are sensory organelles and that their presence in the apical membrane facilitates the formation of a mature ATP secretion apparatus responsive to chemical, osmotic, and mechanical stimuli. The cilium and autocrine ATP signaling appear to work in concert to control cell Ca(2+). Loss of a cilium-dedicated autocrine purinergic signaling system may be a critical underlying etiology for ARPKD and may lead to disinhibition and/or upregulation of multiple sodium (Na(+)) absorptive mechanisms and a resultant severe hypertensive phenotype in ARPKD and, possibly, other diseases.", "score": 1, "id": "18368523", "title": "Loss of apical monocilia on collecting duct principal cells impairs ATP secretion across the apical cell surface and ATP-dependent and flow-induced calcium signals."}, {"abstract": "Joubert syndrome is a severe autosomal recessive disorder, which is characterized by hypotonia, impaired psychomotor development, retinal dystrophy with abnormal ocular movements and cerebellar vermis agenesis with dilatation of the fourth ventricle.

Although MCKD and NPH share morphological features, they differ in several respects. The most common variant is recessive juvenile NPH, with onset in childhood and leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within the 2nd decade of life; the most frequent extrarenal involvement is tapeto-retinal degeneration. MCKD is a dominant condition recognized in later life and leading to ESRD at the age of 50 years; hyperuricemia and gout can be associated features. The first sign of MCKD is polyuria; later, the clinical findings relate to renal insufficiency. Originally, NPH and MCKD were considered separate entities. Subsequently, it has been suggested that the two diseases were a single disorder due to the clinico-pathological identity. This unifying conception was later refuted due to the identification of MCKD dominant families. Recently, considerable insight has been gained into the genetics of the NPH-MCKD complex. The majority of juvenile NPH cases are due to deletion of the NPHP1 gene on chromosome 2q13. Genes for infantile and adolescent NPH have been localized respectively to chromosome 9q22-q31 and 3q22. A new locus, NPHP4, has been recently identified on chromosome 1p36. Two genes predisposing to dominant MCKD, MCKD1 and MCKD2, have been localized to chromosome 1q21 and 16p12. Independent confirmation of the locations of MCKD1 and MCKD2 in other MCKD families, with or without hyperuricemia and gout, has been reported. The gene for familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (FJHN), a phenotype that is very similar to MCKD, was recently mapped to 16p12, in a region overlapping with the MCKD2 locus, raising the question as to whether MCKD2 and FJHN are allelic variants of the same disease entity. The ultimate proof of the allelism between MCKD2 and FJHN will be provided by the identification of the responsible gene(s).

With the aim of cloning the MLIV gene, we searched in the 19p13.2-13.3 region, where the locus previously had been assigned by linkage mapping. In this region, we have identified a novel gene that is mutated in all patients with MLIV who were enrolled in our study. One patient was homozygous for the splice-acceptor mutation, and another was homozygous for a deletion removing the first six exons of the gene. In addition, four compound heterozygotes for these two mutations were identified. Haplotype analysis indicates that we have identified the two major founder mutations, which account for >95% of MLIV chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jewish patients.

For this investigation, retinal cells were isolated from postnatal day 1 (PN1) rats and transformed with the psi2 E1A virus. In order to isolate retinal ganglion cells (RGC), single cell clones were chosen at random from the transformed cells. Expression of Thy-1 (a marker for RGC), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a positive marker for Muller cells), HPC-1/syntaxin (a marker for amacrine cells), 8A1 (a marker for horizontal and ganglion cells) and neurotrophins was studied using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. One of the retinal cell clones, designated RGC-5, was positive for Thy-1, Brn-3C, Neuritin, NMDA receptor, GABA-B receptor, and synaptophysin expression and negative for GFAP, HPC-1, and 8A1, suggesting that it represented a putative RGC clone. The results of RT-PCR analysis were confirmed by immunocytochemistry for Thy-1 and GFAP. Upon further characterization by immunoblotting, the RGC-5 clone was positive for Thy-1, negative for GFAP, 8A1 and syntaxin. RGC 5 cells were also positive for the expression of neurotrophins and their cognate receptors. To establish the physiological relevance of RGC-5, the effects of serum/trophic factor deprivation and glutamate toxicity were analyzed to determine if these cells would undergo apoptosis. The protective effects of neurotrophins on RGC-5 after serum deprivation was also investigated. Apoptosis was studied by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated fluoresceinated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Serum deprivation resulted in apoptosis and supplementation with both BDNF and NT-4 in the growth media, protected the RGC-5 cells from undergoing apoptosis. On differentiation with succinyl concanavalin A (sConA), RGC-5 cells became sensitive to glutamate toxicity, which could be reversed by inclusion of ciplizone (MK801). In conclusion, a transformed rat retinal cell line, RGC-5, has certain characteristics of retinal ganglion cells based on Thy-1 and Brn-3C expression and its sensitivity to glutamate excitotoxicity and neurotrophin withdrawal.

Both modes of release are mediated by synaptic vesicles but probably differ in the regulation of docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. We have found that syntaxin 1, an essential component of the core fusion complex in conventional synapses, is absent from ribbon synapses of the retina, raising the possibility that these synapses contain a different type of syntaxin or syntaxin-like protein. By immunoprecipitating syntaxin 1-depleted retina and brain extracts with a SNAP-25 antibody and microsequencing the precipitated proteins, syntaxin 3 was detected in retina complexed with SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, and complexin. Using an anti-syntaxin 3 antiserum, syntaxin 3 was demonstrated to be present at high levels in retina compared to brain. Immunofluorescent staining of rat retina sections confirmed that syntaxin 3 is expressed by photoreceptor and bipolar cells in the retina. Thus, in the retina, expression of syntaxin 3 is correlated with ribbon synapses and may play a role in the tonic release of neurotransmitter.", "score": 9, "id": "8824312", "title": "A SNARE complex containing syntaxin 3 is present in ribbon synapses of the retina."}, {"abstract": "HPC-1/syntaxin 1A (STX1A) is abundantly expressed in neurons. STX1A is believed to regulate exocytosis in synaptic vesicles. In our recent studies, STX1A knockout (KO) mice showed normal development, and basal synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons appeared to be normal. However, behavioral abnormalities were observed in STX1A KO mice. In the normal rodent retina, the STX1A protein is expressed in two synaptic layers (plexiform layers). Here, to evaluate the effects of the loss of STX1A on retinal structure, we examined the retinal layer structure in STX1A KO mice using hematoxylin staining and immunostaining. We found that the general layer structures in the retina were preserved in all genotypes. However, the outer plexiform layer (OPL) was significantly thicker in KO and heterozygous mutant (HT) mice compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice. No significant differences were observed in the thicknesses of the other layers. Immunostaining for protein kinase C \u03b1 showed that the alignment of rod bipolar cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer (INL) was slightly disrupted in HT and KO retinas. Furthermore, the dendrites of these cells in the OPL of KO mice were sparse, compared to those in WT mice. Our results show that STX1A KO mice have increased thickness of the OPL and changes in the morphology of the INL that may contribute to the change in OPL thickness.

The former is known to be a good marker of synaptogenesis; this aspect, however, is not clear with syntaxin-1. In this study, the expression of both proteins was examined in the developing human retina and compared with their distribution in postnatal to adult retinas, by immunohistochemistry. In the inner plexiform layer, both were expressed simultaneously at 11-12 weeks of gestation, when synaptogenesis reportedly begins in the central retina. In the outer plexiform layer, however, the immunoreactivities were prominent by 16 weeks of gestation. Their expression in both plexiform layers followed a centre-to-periphery gradient. The immunoreactivities for both proteins were found in the immature photoreceptor, amacrine and ganglion cells; however, synaptophysin was differentially localized in bipolar cells and their axons, and syntaxin was present in some horizontal cells. In postnatal-to-adult retinas, synaptophysin immunoreactivity was prominent in photo-receptor terminals lying in the outer plexiform layer; on the contrary, syntaxin-1 was present in a thin immunoreactive band in this layer. In the inner plexiform layer, however, both were homogeneously distributed. Our study suggests that (i) syntaxin-1 appears in parallel with synapse formation; (ii) synaptogenesis in the human retina might follow a centre-to-periphery gradient; (iii) syntaxin-1 is likely to be absent from ribbon synapses of the outer plexiform layer, but may occur at presynaptic terminals of photoreceptor and horizontal cells, as is apparent from its localization in these cells, which is hitherto unreported for any vertebrate retina.", "score": 5, "id": "11426054", "title": "Differential expression of syntaxin-1 and synaptophysin in the developing and adult human retina."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>In a previous study it has been shown that adult rat hippocampus-derived neural stem cells can be successfully transplanted into neonatal retinas, where they differentiate into neurons and glia, but they cannot be transplanted into adult retinas.

In this work, we investigated modulation by C-type natriuretic peptide of functional properties of glutamate receptors in rat retinal GABAergic amacrine cells in culture. Immunocytochemical data revealed that natriuretic peptide receptor-B was strongly expressed on the membrane of cultured GABAergic amacrine cells. By whole cell recording techniques we further identified the glutamate receptor expressed on the GABAergic amacrine cells as an AMPA-preferring subtype. Incubation with C-type natriuretic peptide suppressed the AMPA receptor-mediated current of these cells in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing the efficacy and apparent affinity for glutamate. The effect of C-type natriuretic peptide was reversed by HS-142-1, a guanylyl cyclase-coupled natriuretic peptide receptor-A/B antagonist.

Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to ganglion cell markers NF-L, NeuN, Brn3a, and SMI32 was used to confirm CFP expression in ganglion cells. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to amacrine cell markers HPC-1 and ChAT was used to confirm weak CFP expression in cholinergic amacrine cells. CFP-D2 mice developed a glaucomatous phenotype, including iris disease, ganglion cell loss, attrition of the fiber layer, and elevated intraocular pressure.

To assess the impact of adenosine on Ca(2+) influx though voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in cone terminals, whole-cell perforated-patch clamp recording and Ca(2+) imaging with fluo-4 were used on isolated cones and salamander retinal slices. Synaptic markers (VAMP and piccolo) and activity-dependent dye labeling revealed that tiger salamander cone terminals contain a broad, vesicle-filled cytoplasmic extension at the base of the somatic compartment, which is unlike rod terminals that contain one or more thin axons, each terminating in a large bulbous synaptic terminal.

Prenatal diagnosis by biochemical testing is also possible; however, the biochemical defects in cultured fibroblasts from an affected family member must be confirmed first, since the biochemical defects present in body fluids or liver may not be detectable in cultured cells (a phenomenon called \"peroxisomal mosaicism\").<br/>", "score": 1, "id": "20301621", "title": "Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders, Zellweger Syndrome Spectrum"}], "disease": "recessive Refsum disease, infantile form; protein: peroxisome biogenesis factor 1", "omim": ["202370", "214100", "266510", "602136"], "mode": "r", "known": 1}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "B", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "141", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "C", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00354609929078009", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "N", "Chr": "7", "freq&#46;controls": "0", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2224", "LJB_LRT": "0.995224", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "D", "Ref": "G", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "745", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000127980", "Description": "peroxisomal biogenesis factor 1", "End": "92147353", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "PEX1", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "1", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "Func": "exonic;splicing", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.002", "dbSNP137": "", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "NA", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "PEX1", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:81", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.010654", "signature": "7_92147353_G_A", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "737.69", "Omim": "602136", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "pubmed_score": 4, "Gene": "ENSG00000127980;ENSG00000127980", "Obs": "A", "AAChange": "ENSG00000127980:ENST00000248633:exon5:c.C476T:p.A159V,ENSG00000127980:ENST00000428214:exon5:c.C476T:p.A159V", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "TRUE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "0", "clean&#46;signature": "7_92147353_G_A", "novel": "TRUE", "rare": "TRUE", "Start": "92147353", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "NA", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0.17", "Conserved": "366;Name=lod=41", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "4.45", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "N", "LJB_SIFT": "0.97", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.999728", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "1"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 1000, "indel&#46;length": "1", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 6, "results": [{"abstract": "Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) provides nourishment and protection to the eye. RPE dysfunction due to oxidative stress and inflammation is one of the major reason for many of the retinal disorders. Organophosphorus pesticides are widely used in the agricultural, industrial and household activities in India. However, their effects on the eye in the context of RPE has not been studied. In this study the defense of the ARPE19 cells exposed to Chlorpyrifos (1 nM to 100 \u00b5M) in terms of the enzyme paraoxonase (PON) was studied at 24 hr and 9 days of treatment. Chlorpyrifos was found to induce oxidative stress in the ARPE19 cells as seen by significant increase in ROS and decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels without causing cell death. Tissue resident Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) mRNA expression was elevated with chlorpyrifos exposure. The three enzymatic activities of PON namely, paraoxonase (PONase), arylesterase (PON AREase) and thiolactonase (PON HCTLase) were also found to be significantly altered to detoxify and as an antioxidant defense. Among the transcription factors regulating PON2 expression, SP1 was significantly increased with chlorpyrifos exposure. PON2 expression was found to be crucial as ARPE19 cells showed a significant loss in their ability to withstand oxidative stress when the cells were subjected to chlorpyrifos after silencing PON2 expression. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine positively regulated the PON 2 expression, thus promoting the antioxidant defense put up by the cells in response to chlorpyrifos.", "score": 3, "id": "24979751", "title": "Paraoxonase enzyme protects retinal pigment epithelium from chlorpyrifos insult."}, {"abstract": "<b>OBJECTIVE: </b>Paraoxonase (PON) exhibits esterase activity (PON-AREase) and lactonase activity (PON-HCTLase), which prevent LDL oxidation and detoxify homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL). The role of HCTL and PON-HCTLase as a risk factor for the microvascular complication in diabetic retinopathy at the level of vitreous has not been investigated.<br/><b>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: </b>Undiluted vitreous from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (n = 13) and macular hole (MH) (n = 8) was used to determine PON-HCTLase and PON-AREase activity spectrophotometrically. HCTL levels were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In vitro studies were done in primary cultures of bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells (BRECs) to determine the dose- and time-dependent effect of HCTL and homocysteine (Hcys) on PON-HCTLase activity, as well as to determine mRNA expression of PON by RT-PCR.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>A significant increase in HCTL and PON-HCTLase activity was observed in PDR compared with MH (P = 0.036, P = 0.001), with a significant positive correlation between them (r = 0.77, P = 0.03). The in vitro studies on BRECs showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in the PON-HCTLase activity and mRNA expression of PON2 when exposed to HCTL and Hcys.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>This is the first study showing elevated levels of vitreous HCTL and PON-HCTLase activity in PDR. These elevations are probably a protective effect to eliminate HCTL, which mediates endothelial cell dysfunction. Thus, vitreous levels of HCTL and PON activity can be markers of diabetic retinopathy. The bioinformatics analysis reveals that the structure and function of PON that can be modulated by hyperhomocysteinemia in PDR can affect the dual-enzyme activity of PON.<br/>", "score": 2, "id": "20551012", "title": "Homocysteinethiolactone and paraoxonase: novel markers of diabetic retinopathy."}, {"abstract": "The paraoxonase (PON) enzyme family, comprising PON1, PON2, and PON3, are antioxidant enzymes that degrade oxidised phospholipids.

[{"abstract": "Recent physiological studies in the kidney proposed the existence of a secondary feedback mechanism termed 'crosstalk' localized after the macula densa. This newly discovered crosstalk contact between the nephron tubule and its own afferent arteriole may potentially revolutionize our understanding of renal vascular resistance and electrolyte regulation. However, the nature of such a crosstalk mechanism is still debated due to a lack of direct and comprehensive morphological evidence. Its exact location along the nephron, its prevalence among the different types of nephrons, and the type of cells involved are yet unknown. To address these issues, computer assisted 3-dimensional nephron tracing was applied in combination with direct immunohistochemistry on plastic sections and electron microscopy. 'Random' contacts in the cortex were identified by the tracing and excluded. We investigated a total of 168 nephrons from all cortical regions. The results demonstrated that the crosstalk contact existed, and that it was only present in certain nephrons (90% of the short-looped and 75% of the long-looped nephrons). The crosstalk contacts always occurred at a specific position--the last 10% of the distal convoluted tubule. Importantly, we demonstrated, for the first time, that the cells found in the tubule wall at the contact site were always type nonA-nonB intercalated cells. In conclusion, the present work confirmed the existence of a post macula densa physical crosstalk contact.", "score": 2, "id": "24039709", "title": "Direct physical contact between intercalated cells

"<b>BACKGROUND: </b>To establish new strategies for the treatment of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), we investigated new members of a recently discovered apoptosis-inducing receptor-ligand system in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. TRAIL (Apo2-L) and Apo3-L are capable of inducing cell death via their receptors Trail-R1 to Trail-R4 and TRAMP. The goal of this study was to prove the existence of these new apoptosis-inducing receptors and ligands in RPE cells.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Human RPE cells, cultured or prepared directly from the eye, were examined by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry of epiretinal membranes of traumatic PVR was performed for the detection of TRAIL and Trail-R1. Protein expression of Trail-R1 was examined in cultured human RPE cells by western blot. Cell death after TRAIL treatment of human RPE cells was measured by crystal violet staining.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>For RPE cells derived directly from the eye, we detected mRNAs of Trail-R2, Trail-R3, TRAIL, and APO3-L, but not Trail-R1, Trail-R4, and TRAMP. All the examined transcripts were detected in human P0 RPE cells in vitro. Immunohistochemical studies on PVR membranes identified TRAIL and Trail-R1. Western blot confirmed the presence of Trail-R1 in cultured human RPE cells. TRAIL failed to kill RPE cells in vitro, but showed a strong synergistic killing effect when coincubated with protein (cycloheximide) or RNA (actinomycin D) synthesis inhibitor.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>We detected a novel apoptosis-inducing receptor-ligand system in RPE cells. An induction of apoptosis as a treatment of PVR seems to be possible. Further investigations are needed including an animal model of PVR.<br/>", "score": 2, "id": "12136286", "title": "Apoptosis-mediating receptor-ligand systems in human retinal pigment epithelial

protein tyrosine kinase PYK2 has been implicated in signaling pathways activated by G-protein-coupled receptors, intracellular calcium, and stress signals. Here we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel family of PYK2-binding proteins designated Nirs (PYK2 N-terminal domain-interacting receptors). The three Nir proteins (Nir1, Nir2, and Nir3) bind to the amino-terminal domain of PYK2 via a conserved sequence motif located in the carboxy terminus. The primary structures of Nirs reveal six putative transmembrane domains, a region homologous to phosphatidylinositol (PI) transfer protein, and an acidic domain. The Nir proteins are the human homologues of the Drosophila retinal degeneration B protein (rdgB), a protein implicated in the visual transduction pathway in flies. We demonstrate that Nirs are calcium-binding proteins that exhibit PI transfer activity in vivo. Activation of PYK2 by agents that elevate intracellular calcium or by phorbol ester induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Nirs. Moreover, PYK2 and Nirs exhibit similar expression patterns in several regions of the brain and retina. In addition, PYK2-Nir complexes are detected in lysates prepared from cultured cells or from brain tissues. Finally, the Nir1-encoding gene is located at human chromosome 17p13.1, in proximity to a locus responsible for several human retinal diseases. We propose that the Nir and rdgB proteins represent a new family of evolutionarily conserved PYK2-binding proteins that play a role in the control of calcium and phosphoinositide metabolism downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors.", "score": 4, "id": "10022914", "title": "Identification of a novel family of targets of PYK2 related to Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB) protein."}]},

We have previously demonstrated fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) downregulation in the RPE/choroidal complex in a mouse model of aging and early age-related macular degeneration. FABPs are involved in intracellular transport of FFAs and their targeting to specific metabolic pathways. To elucidate the role of FABP5 in lipid metabolism, the production of the FABP5 protein in a human RPE cell line was inhibited using RNA interference technology. As a result, the levels of cholesterol and cholesterol ester were decreased by about 40%, whereas FFAs and triglycerides were increased by 18 and 67% after siRNA treatment, respectively. Some species of phospholipids were decreased in siRNA-treated cells. Cellular lipid droplets were evident and apoB secretion was decreased by 76% in these cells. Additionally, we discovered that ARPE-19 cells could synthesize and secrete Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), which may serve as a backbone structure for the formation of lipoprotein particles in these cells. Our results indicate that FABP5 mRNA knockdown results in the accumulation of cellular triglycerides, decreased cholesterol levels, and reduced secretion of apoB100 protein and lipoprotein-like particles. These observations indicated that FABP5 plays a critical role in lipid metabolism in RPE cells, suggesting that FABP5 downregulation in the RPE/choroid complex in vivo might contribute to aging and early age-related macular degeneration.", "score": 4, "id": "19434059", "title": "Knockdown of FABP5 mRNA decreases cellular cholesterol levels and results in decreased apoB100 secretion and triglyceride accumulation in ARPE-19 cells."}, {"abstract": "The fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family consists of small, cytosolic proteins believed to be involved in the uptake, transport, and solubilization of their hydrophobic ligands. Members of this family have highly conserved sequences and tertiary structures. Using an antibody against testis lipid-binding protein, a member of the FABP family, a protein was identified from bovine retina and testis that coeluted with exogenously added docosahexaenoic acid during purification. Amino acid sequencing and subsequent isolation of its cDNA revealed it to be nearly identical to a bovine protein expressed in the differentiating lens and to be the likely bovine homologue of the human epidermal fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP). From quantitative Western blot analysis, it was estimated that bovine E-FABP comprised 0.9%, 0.1%, and 2.4% of retina, testis, and lens cytosolic proteins, respectively. Binding studies using the fluorescent probe ADIFAB indicated that this protein bound fatty acids of differing levels of saturation with relatively high affinities. Kd values ranged from 27 to 97 nM. In addition, the protein was immunolocalized to the M\u00fcller cells in the retina as well as to Sertoli cells in the testis. The location of bovine E-FABP in cells known to be supportive to other cell types in their tissues and the ability of E-FABP to bind a variety of fatty acids with similar affinities indicate that it may be involved in the uptake and transport of fatty acids essential for the nourishment of the surrounding cell types.", "score": 4, "id": "9521644", "title": "Bovine epidermal fatty acid-binding protein: determination of ligand specificity and cellular localization in retina and testis."}, {"abstract": "4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is a cytotoxic alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl aldehyde that is naturally produced from lipid peroxidation and cleavage in response to oxidative stress and aging.

Identification of Cys-120 as the major site of modification was determined through tandem mass spectral sequencing of tryptic peptides, as well as analysis of E-FABP mutants C120A, C127A, and C120A/C127A. The in vitro modification of Cys-120 by 4-HNE was relatively insensitive to pH (6.4-8.4), and temperature (4-37 degrees C) but was markedly potentiated by noncovalently bound fatty acids. 4-HNE-modified E-FABP was more stable than unmodified E-FABP to chemical denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride, as assessed by changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Analysis of soluble protein extracts from rat retina with antibodies directed to 4-HNE-protein conjugates revealed immunoreactivity with a 15-kDa protein that was identified by electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry as E-FABP. Evaluation of retinal pigment epithelial cell extracts derived from E-FABP null mice by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using anti-4-HNE antibodies revealed increased modification in the null cells relative to those from wild type cells.

Northern blot analysis showed that the lens mRNA was at a concentration that exceeded 100-fold that found in non-ocular tissues examined, except in skin it was found at levels equal to about 1/15 of the lens levels. In the retina, it was also found at about 1/15 of that present in the lens. By in situ hybridization analysis, the sense RNA was localized to the LE cells and to the glial cells of the retina, and negligibly to the lens fiber cells. Search of GenBank, EMBL and SwissProt data bases revealed that the LE cell mRNA and its aa encoded protein showed extensive sequence homology to members of the cytosolic lipid-binding protein (LBP) family. It matched to 91% in aa sequence homology to the protein encoded by ORF of mal1 cDNA, isolated from mouse skin squamous cell carcinoma [Krieg et al., J. Biol.

The 3.4 kb zebrafish fabp11b is the paralog of the previously described zebrafish fabp11a, with a deduced amino acid sequence for Fabp11B exhibiting 65% identity with that of Fabp11A. Whole mount in situ hybridization of a riboprobe to embryos and larvae showed that zebrafish fabp11b transcripts were restricted solely to the retina and were first detected at 24 h postfertilization. In situ hybridization revealed fabp11b transcripts along the spinal cord in adult zebrafish. However, the highly sensitive RT-PCR assay detected fabp11b transcripts in the brain, heart, ovary and eye in adult tissues. By contrast, fabp11a transcripts had been previously detected in the liver, brain, heart, testis, muscle, ovary and skin of adult zebrafish. Using the LN54 radiation hybrid panel, we assigned zebrafish fabp11b to linkage group 16. Phylogenetic analysis and conserved gene synteny with tetrapod genes indicated that the emergence of two copies of fabp11 in the zebrafish genome may have resulted from a fish-specific whole genome duplication event. Furthermore, we propose that the FABP4-FABP5-FABP8-FABP9 (PERF15) gene cluster on a single chromosome in the tetrapod genome and the fabp11 genes in the zebrafish genome originated from a common ancestral gene, which, following their divergence, gave rise to the fabp11 genes of zebrafish, and the progenitor of the FABP4, FABP5, FABP8 and FABP9 genes in tetrapods after the separation of the fish and tetrapod lineages.", "score": 1, "id": "18445037", "title": "The evolutionary relationship between the duplicated copies of the zebrafish fabp11 gene and the tetrapod FABP4, FABP5, FABP8 and FABP9 genes."}, {"abstract": "The diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) was originally isolated from the brain as an intrinsic ligand of the benzodiazepine binding site on the type-A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A) receptor). Its wide-spread distribution in non-neural tissues outside the brain suggests that DBI has various functions other than GABA-mediated neurotransmission. Since DBI is identical with the acyl-CoA binding protein, which has the ability to bind long chain acyl-CoA esters, the major function of DBI may possibly be related to lipid metabolism. This idea was supported by our previous study showing the consistent coexpression of DBI and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) in epithelia throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The present histochemical study focused on the distribution of DBI in neural tissues, and revealed a definite existence of DBI in non-neuronal supporting cells in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the brain, intense immunoreactivity for DBI was detected in the cerebellar Bergmann glia, olfactory ensheathing glia, subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus, and retinal Muller cells. In the peripheral nervous system, satellite cells in sensory/autonomic ganglia, Schwann cells, and sustentacular cells in the adrenal medulla were immunoreactive to a DBI antibody. Moreover, the colocalization of DPI and brain-type FABP (B-FABP) was observed in most of the non-neuronal supporting cells mentioned above, indicating that DBI and B-FABP are cooperatively involved in the energy metabolism of astrocytes and related cells, which are thought to support neuronal development and functions.", "score": 1, "id": "12002608", "title": "Cellular localization of the diazepam binding inhibitor in glial cells with special reference to its coexistence with brain-type fatty acid binding protein."}, {"abstract": "A basic fatty acid binding protein (FABP), closely related to that of chicken liver, was isolated and characterized from catfish (Rhamdia sapo) liver in a previous work.

epilepsy gene hunting lead to better care for patients with epilepsy? Lessons may be learned from the progress made by identifying the mutated genes that cause Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions (BFNC). In 1998, a decade of clinical and laboratory-based genetics work resulted in the cloning of the KCNQ2 potassium channel gene at the BFNC locus on chromosome 20. Subsequently, computer \"mining\" of public DNA databases allowed the rapid identification of three more brain KCNQ genes. Mutations in each of these additional genes were implicated as causes of human hereditary diseases: epilepsy (KCNQ3), deafness (KCNQ4), and, possibly, retinal degeneration (KCNQ5). Physiologists discovered that the KCNQ genes encoded subunits of the \"M-channel,\" a type of potassium channel known to control repetitive neuronal discharges. Finally, pharmacologists discovered that retigabine, a novel anticonvulsant with a broad but distinctive efficacy profile in animal studies, was a potent KCNQ channel opener. These studies suggest that KCNQ channels may be an important new class of targets for anticonvulsant therapies. The efficacy of retigabine is currently being tested in multicenter clinical trials; identification of its molecular targets will allow it to be more efficiently exploited as a \"lead compound.\" Cloned human KCNQ channels can now be expressed in cultured cells for \"high-throughput\" screening of drug candidates. Ongoing studies of the KCNQ channels in humans and animal models will refine our understanding of how M-channels control excitability at the cellular, network, and behavioral levels, and may reveal additional targets for therapeutic manipulation.", "score": 1, "id": "11887968", "title": "Potassium channels: how genetic studies of epileptic syndromes open paths to new therapeutic targets and

WNT signals are transduced through Frizzled (FZD) family receptor and LRP5/LRP6 co-receptor to upregulate MYC, CCND1, FGF20, JAG1, WISP1 and DKK1 genes, while non-canonical WNT signals are transduced through FZD family receptor and PTK7/ROR2/RYK co-receptor to activate RHOA/RHOU/RAC/CDC42, JNK, PKC, NFAT and NLK signaling cascades. FZD7, expressed in the normal gastrointestinal tract, is upregulated in esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 genes were identified and characterized by using bioinformatics (Techint) and human intelligence (Humint). Chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 genes were identified within NW_001232110.1 and AC173037.2 genome sequences, respectively. Chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 showed 100% and 97.2% total-amino-acid identity with human FZD7. All of the nine amino-acid residues substituted between human FZD7 and human FzE3 were identical to those of human FZD7 in chimpanzee, cow, mouse and rat FZD7 orthologs.

The model of retinal photodamage could be applied to age-related macular degeneration and other degenerative retinal diseases for exploring new treatments. Based on broadly investigated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in the field of retinal degeneration, we aimed to clarify further how the interaction progresses between iPSC-conditional medium (CM) and light-damaged retina.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>iPSCs were generated from murine embryonic fibroblasts of C57/B6 mice by retroviral transfection of three factors: Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4. Cytokine array was performed to analyze the components of CM. Sprague-Dawley rats receiving white light exposure to retina were viewed as an animal model of light injury. The rats were divided into four subgroups: light-injured rats receiving intravitreal injection of iPSC-CM, apoptotic iPSC-CM, or sodium phosphate buffer (PBS); and a control group without light damage. The electroretinography and thickness of outer nuclear layer were measured to document the therapeutic effects in each condition. Apoptosis arrays for detecting annexin V and caspase 3 were performed in the retinal tissues from each group.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Murine embryonic fibroblasts were induced into iPSCs and expressed the marker genes similar to embryonic stem cells. These iPSCs can differentiate into Embryoid bodies (EBs), three germ layers in\u00a0vitro and develop teratoma in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction of our iPSC-CM showed significantly elevated fibroblast growth factor-2, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins-1, -2, and -3. Compared to rats without photodamage, the light-injured rats receiving iPSC-CM had less reduction of outer nuclear layer thickness on Day 21 than other groups treated with either PBS or apoptotic iPSC-CM. In the same animal model, both a- and b-waves of electroretinography measurement in the group treated with iPSC-CM were significantly maintained compared to the control group and others with apoptotic iPSC-CM or PBS treatment.

The embryonic chick can regenerate its retina by transdifferentiation of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and by activation of stem/progenitor cells present in the ciliary margin. These two ways of regeneration occur concomitantly when an external source of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is present after injury (retinectomy). During the process of transdifferentiation, the RPE loses its pigmentation and is reprogrammed to become neuroepithelium, which differentiates to reconstitute the different cell types of the neural retina. Somatic mammalian cells can be reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells by ectopic expression of pluripotency-inducing factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc and in some cases Nanog and Lin-28. However, there is limited information concerning the expression of these factors during natural regenerative processes. Organisms that are able to regenerate their organs could share similar mechanisms and factors with the reprogramming process of somatic cells. Herein, we investigate the expression of pluripotency-inducing factors in the RPE after retinectomy (injury) and during transdifferentiation in the presence of FGF2.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>We present evidence that upon injury, the quiescent (p27(Kip1)+/BrdU-) RPE cells transiently dedifferentiate and express sox2, c-myc and klf4 along with eye field transcriptional factors and display a differential up-regulation of alternative splice variants of pax6. However, this transient process of dedifferentiation is not sustained unless FGF2 is present. We have identified lin-28 as a downstream target of FGF2 during the process of retina regeneration. Moreover, we show that overexpression of lin-28 after retinectomy was sufficient to induce transdifferentiation of the RPE in the absence of FGF2.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>These findings delineate in detail the molecular changes that take place in the RPE during the process of transdifferentiation in the embryonic chick, and specifically identify Lin-28 as an important factor in this process.

We compared the endogenous expression levels of four pluripotency factors and the pluripotency reprograming efficiency of human OECs with that of ocular stromal cells (OSCs). Real-time PCR, microarray analysis, Western blotting and immunostaining assays were employed to compare OECiPSCs with OSCiPSCs on molecular bases of reprogramming efficiency and preferred lineage-differentiation potential. Using the traditional KMOS (KLF4, C-MYC, OCT4 and SOX2) reprogramming protocol, we confirmed that OECs, endogenously expressing reprogramming factors OCT4A and SOX2, yield very high efficiency of iPSCs generation (~1.5%). Furthermore, higher efficiency of retinal pigmented epithelial differentiation (RPE cells) was observed in OECiPSCs compared to OSCiPSCs or skin fibroblast iMR90iPSCs. The findings in this study suggest that conjunctival-derived epithelial (OECs) cells can be easier converted to iPSCs than conjunctival-derived stromal cells (OSCs). This cell type may also have advantages in retinal pigmented epithelial differentiation.", "score": 2, "id": "26131692", "title": "Human Ocular Epithelial Cells Endogenously Expressing SOX2 and OCT4 Yield High Efficiency of Pluripotency Reprogramming."}, {"abstract": "The transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) has been implicated in regulating cell proliferation, migration and differentiation in a variety of human cells and is one of four factors required for the induction of pluripotent stem cell reprogramming.

The functional role of KLF4 in HRMECs was determined following lentiviral vector mediated inducible expression and shRNA knockdown of KLF4. Inducible expression of KLF4 promotes cell proliferation, migration and tube formation.

Fibroblast cultures were established from skin biopsy material and subsequently reprogrammed following polycistronic lentiviral transduction with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and L-Myc. Fibroblast-derived iPSCs showed typical morphology, chromosomal integrity and a distinctive stem cell marker profile. Subsequent differentiation resulted in expandable pigmented hexagonal RPE cells. The cells revealed stable RNA expression of mature RPE markers RPE65, RLBP and BEST1. Immunolabelling verified localisation of BEST1 at the basolateral plasma membrane, and scanning electron microscopy showed typical microvilli at the apical side of iPSC-derived RPE cells. Transepithelial resistance was maintained at high levels during cell culture indicating functional formation of tight junctions. Secretion capacity was demonstrated for VEGF-A. Feeding of porcine photoreceptor outer segments revealed the proper ability of these cells for phagocytosis. IPSC-derived RPE cells largely maintained these properties after cryopreservation.

In addition, we performed sequential quantitative assessment of a defined transcription profile consisting of 15 progenitor- and lineage-associated genes following exposure to the same treatment protocols, to examine the temporal dynamics of phenotypic changes following induction of differentiation. Immunocytochemistry was also used to examine the expression of seven of these phenotypically important genes at the protein level. Initial primary isolates were passaged four times in proliferation medium containing 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) before differentiation was induced. Differentiation was induced by medium without EGF or bFGF and containing either 10 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cultures were fed every two days and harvested on days 0, 1, 3, and 5 for quantitative real-time PCR.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>The microarray results illustrated and contrasted the global shifts in the porcine transcriptome associated with both treatment conditions. PCR confirmed dramatic upregulation of transcripts for myelin basic protein (up to 88 fold), claudin 11 (up to 32 fold), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; up to 26 fold), together with notable (>twofold) increases in message for microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), Janus kinase 1 (Jak1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).

Our results also suggest that the PDZ-binding domain in Crb2a might bring a protein(s) into the Crb complex that alters the function of the FERM-binding domain.<br/>", "score": 1, "id": "20670434", "title": "Multiple domains in the Crumbs Homolog 2a (Crb2a) protein are required for regulating rod photoreceptor size."}]}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "135", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00370370370370365", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "", "Chr": "9", "freq&#46;controls": "0.000721500721500679", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2079", "LJB_LRT": "NA", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "", "Ref": "C", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "701", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000148204", "Description": "crumbs homolog 2 (Drosophila)", "End": "126129849", "non&#46;syn": "FALSE", "HUGO": "CRB2(ENST00000359999:exon6:c.941-3C>T,ENST00000373631:exon6:c.941-3C>T)", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "1", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "Func": "splicing", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "NA", "dbSNP137": "", "ExonicFunc": "", "ESP6500si_ALL": "NA", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "CRB2", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:16", "LJB_MutationTaster": "NA", "signature": "9_126129849_C_T", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "967.13", "Omim": "609720;268000", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "pubmed_score": 115, "Gene": "ENSG00000148204(ENST00000359999:exon6:c.941-3C>T,ENST00000373631:exon6:c.941-3C>T)", "Obs": "T", "AAChange": "", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "3", "clean&#46;signature": "9_126129849_C_T", "novel": "FALSE", "rare": "TRUE", "Start": "126129849", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "NA", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0.0425531914893617", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "NA", "Conserved": "352;Name=lod=36", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "NA", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "", "LJB_SIFT": "NA", "LJB_PhyloP": "NA", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "1"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 35, "indel&#46;length": "0", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 0, "results": []}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "D", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "141", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "C", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00354609929078009", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "D", "Chr": "9", "freq&#46;controls": "0.00116686114352393", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2571", "LJB_LRT": "0.999999", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "T", "Ref": "G", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "854", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000136856", "Description": "solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 8", "End": "130167788", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "SLC2A8", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "1", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "4", "Func": "exonic", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.97", "dbSNP137": "rs201045999", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "NA", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "SLC2A8", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:100", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.998702", "signature": "9_130167788_G_A", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "16340.55", "Omim": "605245", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0.00234192037470726", "pubmed_score": 0, "Gene": "ENSG00000136856", "Obs": "A", "AAChange": "ENSG00000136856:ENST00000373352:exon6:c.G451A:p.V151I,ENSG00000136856:ENST00000430147:exon6:c.G757A:p.V253I,ENSG00000136856:ENST00000451404:exon7:c.G751A:p.V251I,ENSG00000136856:ENST00000373371:exon9:c.G1240A:p.V414I", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "6", "clean&#46;signature": "9_130167788_G_A", "novel": "FALSE", "rare": "FALSE", "Start": "130167788", "cg69": "0.007", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "NA", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0.04", "Conserved": "583;Name=lod=312", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "3.56", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "D", "LJB_SIFT": "0.86", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.991489", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "1"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 13, "indel&#46;length": "0", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 5, "results": [{"abstract": "Adenylate kinases (AKs) are ubiquitous phosphotransferases that contribute to homeostasis of adenine nucleotide composition in cells.

[{"abstract": "<b>CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: </b>Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is characterized by proliferation and infiltration of hyperactivated macrophages and T-lymphocytes manifesting as acute illness with prolonged fever, cytopenias, and hepatosplenomegaly. Onset is typically within the first months or years of life and, on occasion, in utero, although later childhood or adult onset is more common than previously suspected. Neurologic abnormalities may be present initially or may develop later; they may include increased intracranial pressure, irritability, neck stiffness, hypotonia, hypertonia, convulsions, cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, hemiplegia, quadriplegia, blindness, and coma. Rash and lymphadenopathy are less common. Other findings include liver dysfunction and bone marrow hemophagocytosis. The median survival of children with typical FHL, without treatment, is less than two months; progression of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and infection account for the majority of deaths in untreated individuals.<br/><b>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: </b>The diagnosis of FHL is made based on the presence of clinical criteria and is confirmed by molecular genetic testing. Five disease subtypes (FHL1, FHL2, FHL3, FHL4, and FHL5) are described. Four genes in which mutations are causative have been identified: PRF1 (FHL2), UNC13D (FHL3), STX11 (FHL4), and STXBP2 (FHL5).<br/><b>MANAGEMENT: </b>Treatment of manifestations: Antibiotics or antiviral agents are used to treat or prevent infections that may have triggered the exaggerated inflammatory response. Individuals suspected of having FHL or diagnosed with FHL are treated with chemotherapy and immunotherapy to achieve clinical stability prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Prevention of primary manifestations: Allogeneic HCT is the only curative therapy and is undertaken as early in life as feasible in children with confirmed FHL. Surveillance: Following HCT, annual neuropsychological evaluation and regular follow up by a transplant specialist to monitor for late complications related to growth and hormone function is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Live vaccines; exposure to infections. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of at-risk sibs for the family-specific mutations enables consideration of presymptomatic bone marrow transplantation and timely treatment.<br/><b>GENETIC COUNSELING: </b>FHL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once an at-risk sib is known to be unaffected, the risk of his/her being a carrier is 2/3. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the two pathogenic variants in the family are known.<br/>", "score": 1, "id": "20301617",

ear and retina of wild-type and homozygous Cdh23(v-6J) (waltzer) mice. Antibodies generated against CDH23 isoforms were used in immunohistochemistry, immunohistology, electron microscopy, and western blot analyses of mouse and primate inner ear and retina to study the distribution of these isoforms in various cellular compartments.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Cdh23 mRNA alternative splice variants were temporally and spatially regulated in the inner ear and retina. In the mature mouse retina, CDH23 isoforms were broadly expressed in various cellular compartments of the photoreceptor layer.

Mutations in USH type 1 genes cause the most severe form of USH. In USH1 patients, congenital deafness is combined with a pre-pubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and severe vestibular dysfunctions. Those with USH2 have moderate to severe congenital hearing loss, non-vestibular dysfunction and a later onset of RP. USH3 is characterized by variable RP and vestibular dysfunction combined with progressive hearing loss. The gene products of eight identified USH genes belong to different protein classes and families. There are five known USH1 molecules: the molecular motor myosin VIIa (USH1B); the two cell-cell adhesion cadherin proteins, cadherin 23 (USH1D) and protocadherin 15, (USH1F) and the scaffold proteins, harmonin (USH1C) and SANS (USH1G). In addition, two USH2 genes and one USH3A gene have been identified. The two USH2 genes code for the transmembrane protein USH2A, also termed USH2A (\"usherin\") and the G-protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptor VLGR1b (USH2C), respectively, whereas the USH3A gene encodes clarin-1, a member of the clarin family which exhibits 4-transmembrane domains. Molecular analysis of USH1 protein function revealed that all five USH1 proteins are integrated into a protein network via binding to PDZ domains in the USH1C protein harmonin. Furthermore, this scaffold function of harmonin is supported by the USH1G protein SANS. Recently, we have shown that the USH2 proteins USH2A and VLGR1b as well as the candidate for USH2B, the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter NBC3, are also integrated into this USH protein network.

Moreover, harmonin b interacts directly with myosin VIIa, and is absent from the disorganized hair bundles of myosin VIIa mutant mice, suggesting that myosin VIIa conveys harmonin b along the actin core of the developing stereocilia. We propose that the shaping of the hair bundle relies on a functional unit composed of myosin VIIa, harmonin b and cadherin 23 that is essential to ensure the cohesion of the stereocilia.", "score": 1, "id": "12485990", "title": "Myosin VIIa, harmonin and cadherin 23, three Usher I gene products that cooperate to shape the sensory hair cell bundle."}, {"abstract": "Usher syndrome (USH) is a group of autosomal recessive sensory disorders characterized by progressive retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and sensorineural hearing impairment. Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1), with additional vestibular dysfunction, represents the most severe form and shows extensive allelic and non-allelic heterogeneity. At least six USH1 loci exist (USH1A-F), and four of the underlying genes have been identified. Recently, a novel gene, cadherin 23 (CDH23), was shown to be mutated in USH1D. We performed mutation screening by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing on 33 USH1 patients previously excluded for USH1B and USH1C. On eight disease alleles of four patients, four different mutations were identified, three of them novel (c.6933delT, c.5712G-->A, and IVS45-9G-->A). Exon trapping experiments were performed with two mutations. In the case of a c.5712G-->A transition of the last base of exon 42, that is an apparently synonymous mutation, skipping of exon 42 was observed. By the mutation IVS45-9G-->A, a novel splice acceptor site was created and the insertion of 7 intronic bp was observed. Two mutations, IVS45-9G-->A and the previously described IVS51+5G-->A, were each found in more than one patient. Haplotype analysis by SNPs within CDH23 suggests common ancestors for each of the mutations. Among the total of 52 USH1 cases studied by us, CDH23 mutations account for about 10% of all disease alleles. Our results further suggest that in patients with a typical USH1D phenotype, a significant portion of CDH23 mutations leads to premature termination of translation or loss of numerous amino acid residues, with a high frequency of changes causing aberrant splicing of CDH23 mRNA.", "score": 1, "id": "11857743", "title": "Identification and in vitro expression of novel CDH23 mutations of

pig eye is similar to the human eye in terms of anatomy, vasculature, and photoreceptor distribution, and therefore provides an attractive animal model for research into retinal disease. The purpose of this study was to characterize retinal histology in the developing and mature pig retina using antibodies to well established retinal cell markers commonly used in rodents.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Eyes were enucleated from fetuses in the 9th week of gestation, 1 week old piglets and 6 months old adult animals. Eyeglobes were fixed and cryosectioned. A panel of antibodies to well established retinal markers was employed for immunohistochemistry. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were used for signal detection, and images were acquired by confocal microscopy. Mouse retina at postnatal day (P) 5 was used as a reference for this study to compare progression of histogenesis. Most of the primary antibodies have previously been used on mouse tissue.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Most of the studied markers were detected in midgestation pig retina, and the majority had a similar distribution in pig as in P5 mouse retina. However, rhodopsin immunolabeling was detected in pig retina at midgestation but not in P5 mouse retina. Contrary to findings in all rodents, horizontal cells were Islet1-positive and cones were calbindin-immunoreactive in pig retina, as has also been shown for the primate retina. Recoverin and rhodopsin immunolabeling revealed an increase in the length of photoreceptor segments in 6 months, compared to 1 week old animals.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Comparison with the published data on human retina revealed similar marker distribution and histogenesis progression in the pig and human retina, supporting the pig as a valuable animal model for studies on retinal disease and repair. Furthermore, this study provides information about the dynamics of retinal histogenesis in the pig and validates a panel of antibodies that reliably detects developing and mature retinal cell phenotypes in the pig retina.<br/>", "score": 19, "id": "19784390", "title": "Immunohistochemical study of pig retinal development."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>The purpose of this study was to assess survival of adult mammalian neurosensory retina cultured in contact with the layer of a choroid-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) explant.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>The entire adult porcine neurosensory retina and RPE-choroid layer were placed in tissue culture by juxtaposing both tissues in their original orientation.

In amphibians and fish the retinal margin continues to proliferate throughout life, resulting in retinal expansion. This does not happen in mammals. However, some mammalian peripheral retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells continue to divide, perhaps as a vestige of this mechanism. The RPE cells are adjacent to the ciliary margin, a known stem cell source. Here we test the hypothesis that peripheral RPE is fundamentally different from central RPE by challenging different regions with microscopic laser burns and charting differential responses in terms of levels of proliferation and the regions over which this proliferation occurs.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Microscopic RPE lesions were undertaken in rats at different eccentricities and the tissue stained for proliferative markers Ki67 and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and the remodeling metalloproteinase marker 2 (MMP2).<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>All lesions produced local RPE proliferation and tissue remodeling. Significantly more mitosis resulted from peripheral than central lesions. Unexpectedly, single lesions also resulted in RPE cells proliferating across the entire retina. Their number did not increase linearly with lesion number, indicating that they may be a specific population. All lesions repaired and formed apparently normal relations with the neural retina. Repaired RPE was albino.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>These results highlight regional RPE differences, revealing an enhanced peripheral repair capacity.

Although it is known that diabetes increases the placental size and weight, the mechanisms responsible for this alteration are still poorly understood. In mammals, cellular proliferation occurs in parallel to placental development and it is possible that diabetes induces abnormal uncontrolled cell proliferation in the placenta similar to that seen in other organs (e.g. retina). To test this hypothesis, the objective of this work was to determine cell proliferation in different regions of the placenta during its development in a diabetic rat model. Accordingly, diabetes was induced on day 2 of pregnancy in Wistar rats by a single injection of alloxan (40 mg/kg i.v.). Placentas were collected on days 14, 17, and 20 postcoitum. Immunoperoxidase was used to identify Ki67 nuclear antigen in placental sections. The number of proliferating cells was determined in the total placental area as well as in the labyrinth, spongiotrophoblast and giant trophoblast cell regions. During the course of pregnancy, the number of Ki67 positive cells decreased in both control and diabetic rat placentas. However, starting from day 17 of pregnancy, the number of Ki67 positive cells in the labyrinth and spongiotrophoblast regions was higher in diabetic rat placentas as compared to control. The present results demonstrate that placentas from the diabetic rat model have a significantly higher number of proliferating cells in specific regions of the placenta and at defined developmental stages.

Adult human liver microsomes (HLMS) were incubated with t-ROH, and retinoids generated were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, HPLC, and other methods. HLMS-catalyzed generation of t-RAL from t-ROH was primarily NADPH-dependent and was strongly inhibited by carbon monoxide.

Catalysis of the biotransformation of t-ROH by prenatal human cytosolic fractions resulted in accumulation of t-RAL with minimal t-RA. Oxidations of t-ROH catalyzed by prenatal cytosol were supported by both NAD+ and NADP+, although NAD+ was a much better cofactor. In contrast, catalysis of the oxidation of t-RAL to t-RA appeared to be solely NAD+ dependent. Substrate Km values for conversions of t-ROH to t-RAL and of t-RAL to t-RA were 82.4 and 65.8 microM, respectively. At concentrations of 10 and 90 mM, ethanol inhibited the conversion of t-ROH to t-RAL by 25 and 43%, respectively, but did not inhibit the conversion of t-RAL to t-RA significantly. In contrast, acetaldehyde reduced the conversion of t-RAL to t-RA by 25 and 87% at 0.1 and 10 mM respective concentrations. Several alcohols and aldehydes known to be generated from lipid peroxides also exhibited significant inhibition of t-RA biosynthesis in human prenatal hepatic tissues. Among the compounds tested, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) was highly effective in inhibiting the conversion of t-RAL to t-RA.

In summary, these studies suggest that ethanol may affect the biosynthesis of t-RA in human prenatal hepatic tissues directly and indirectly. Ethanol and its major oxidative metabolite, acetaldehyde, both inhibit the generation of t-RA. Concurrently, the CYP2E1-catalyzed oxidation of ethanol can initiate lipid peroxidation via generation of a variety of free radicals.

It occurs in many dimeric isoenzyme forms which are divided into three classes, according to substrate specifics and other chemical-physical properties. ADH is regulated by development and sex, its activity has been described in many tissues (liver, stomach, kidneys, ovaria, uterus, testes, retina, iris). In 1991 Yoshida found a new gene of alcohol dehydrogenase-ADH 6. 4-hydroxyalkenals, cytotoxic products of lipid peroxidation, are also substrates of ADH. Acetaldehyde is further metabolised by aldehyde dehydrogenase (AIDH) to acetate. AIDH occurs in the form of several isoenzymes in cytosole, mitochondria and microsomes of almost all tissues. Acetaldehyde thus binds to nucleic acids, phospholipids and especially to proteins, it may change their structure and function. In activates collagen synthesis and stimulates lipid peroxidation. Human body may be impaired by immune reaction caused by acetaldehyde binding proteins. Acetaldehyde has the function of a hapten.

In this study, we perform a more comprehensive evaluation of human AMPD3 gene expression. Combined Northern blot and RNase protection analyses show that alternative mRNAs are widely expressed in human tissues and cells, but at variable relative abundances. Sequencing of human genomic clones, together with human-mouse somatic cell hybrid analysis, demonstrates that the entire gene is comprised of seventeen exons spanning approx. 60 kilobases on the short arm of chromosome 11 in the region p13-pter. Together, RT-PCR and additional RNase protection analyses establish that exons 1a, 1b, and 1c are 5' terminal sequences in alternative transcripts. Transient transfection experiments show fusion constructs containing proximal flanking and 5' untranslated sequence from each of these exons are able to direct expression of a reporter luciferase gene in mammalian cell lines. These combined results reveal that AMPD3 gene expression is subject to transcriptional control by three tandem promoters. Differential regulation of the exon 1b promoter in skeletal myocytes, as compared to retinal pigment epithelial cells, is proposed to be mediated by skeletal muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix protein/E-box interactions. Finally, an internal splice acceptor site in exon 1c is shown to be used alternatively to retain the 3' portion of this exon in mature AMPD3 transcripts initiating upstream in exon 1b.", "score": 1,

cellular level, including neural and glial remodeling. Structural changes in M\u00fcller cells, the large radial glia of the retina in retinal disease and injury have been well described, that of the retinal astrocytes remains less so. Using modern imaging technology to describe the structural remodeling of retinal astrocytes after retinal detachment is the focus of this paper. We present both a review of critical literature as well as novel work focusing on the responses of astrocytes following rhegmatogenous and serous retinal detachment. The mouse presents a convenient model system in which to study astrocyte reactivity since the M\u03cbller cell response is muted in comparison to other species thereby allowing better visualization of the astrocytes. We also show data from rat, cat, squirrel, and human retina demonstrating similarities and differences across species. Our data from immunolabeling and dye-filling experiments demonstrate previously undescribed morphological characteristics of normal astrocytes and changes induced by detachment. Astrocytes not only upregulate GFAP, but structurally remodel, becoming increasingly irregular in appearance, and often penetrating deep into neural retina. Understanding these responses, their consequences, and what drives them may prove to be an important component in improving visual outcome in a variety of therapeutic situations.

This study investigated the protective effects of total flavones from H. rhamnoides (TFH) against visible light-induced retinal damage and explored the related mechanisms in pigmented rabbits.

Retinal degeneration was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and performing the TUNEL assay 7 days after light exposure. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms of TFH during visible light-induced retinal degeneration. Light exposure produced a degenerative effect primarily on the ONL, inner nuclear layer (INL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL). TFH significantly attenuated the destruction of electroretinograms caused by light damage, maintained ONL thickness, and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the INL and GCL. TFH ameliorated the retinal oxidative stress (GSH-Px, CAT, T-AOC, and MDA), inflammation (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), angiogenesis (VEGF), and apoptosis (Bax, Bcl2, and caspase-3) induced by light exposure.

Because the relaxation of retinal pericytes alters the microcirculatory hemodynamics, it is important to understand the manner of NO production in retinal pericytes. The purpose of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism(s) of uptake of L-Arg in retinal pericytes using a conditionally immortalized rat retinal pericyte cell line (TR-rPCT1 cells) which expresses the mRNAs of endothelial NO synthase and inducible NO synthase. L-Arg uptake by TR-rPCT1 cells exhibited Na(+)-independence and concentration-dependence with a Km of 28.9 \u00b5M. This process was strongly inhibited by substrates of cationic amino acid transporters (CAT), such as L-ornithine and L-lysine. In contrast, L-valine, L-leucine, and L-glutamine, which are substrates of cation/neutral amino acid transport systems, such as system y(+)L, system B(0,+), and system b(0,+), did not strongly inhibit L-Arg uptake by TR-rPCT1 cells. In addition, the expression of mRNA and protein of CAT1 in TR-rPCT1 cells was observed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses.

The production of antioxidant proteins, metallothionein, and inflammatory cytokines was assayed with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell survival was analyzed with microscopy and a cell titer assay. Integrity of the RPE monolayer was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and with immunocytochemistry with zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) antibody. RPE atrophy was studied in mice deleted for Sod2 (the gene for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase) specifically in the RPE. The mice were treated orally with daily doses of xaliproden at 0.5 and 3 mg/kg for 4 months. The retinal structure was analyzed with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and with light and electron microscopy. Retinal function was assessed with full-field electroretinography (ERG) and with optokinetic measurements.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Xaliproden led to a dose-dependent increase in cell survival following treatment with paraquat. Synthesis of the antioxidant response genes NqO1, GSTM1, CAT, HO-1, and Nrf2 was increased in response to the drug, as was the zinc chaperone metallothionein. Treatment of cells with TNF-\u03b1 led to increased production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by ARPE-19 cells, and this response was attenuated by treatment with xaliproden. TNF-\u03b1 also led to a decrease in the TEER that was prevented by treatment with the 5HT1a agonist. Daily gavage with xaliproden at either dose induced the production of protective enzymes in the mouse retina, and treatment of the Sod2-deleted mice with the drug showed improved thickness of the outer nuclear layer and improved visual acuity relative to the control-treated mice. There was no significant difference in full-field scotopic ERG among the treatment groups, however.

Ligands for \u03c31R, a unique transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and nuclear and plasma membranes, have profound retinal neuroprotective properties in vitro and in vivo. Studies to determine the mechanism of \u03c31R-mediated retinal neuroprotection have focused mainly on neurons. Little is known about the effects of \u03c31R on M\u00fcller cell function, yet these radial glial cells are essential for homeostatic support of the retina. Here we investigated whether \u03c31R mediates the oxidative stress response of M\u00fcller cells using wild-type (WT) and \u03c31R-knockout (\u03c31RKO) mice. We observed increased endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in \u03c31RKO M\u00fcller cells compared to WT, which was accompanied by decreased expression of Sod1, catalase, Nqo1, Hmox1, Gstm6, and Gpx1. The protein levels of SOD1, CAT, NQO1, and GPX1 were also significantly decreased. The genes encoding these antioxidants contain an antioxidant response element (ARE), which under stress is activated by NRF2, a transcription factor that typically resides in the cytoplasm bound by KEAP1. In the \u03c31RKO M\u00fcller cells Nrf2 expression was decreased significantly at the gene (and protein) level, whereas Keap1 gene (and protein) levels were markedly increased. NRF2-ARE binding affinity was decreased markedly in \u03c31RKO M\u00fcller cells. We investigated system xc(-), the cystine-glutamate exchanger important for synthesis of glutathione (GSH), and observed decreased function in \u03c31RKO M\u00fcller cells compared to WT as well as decreased GSH and GSH/GSSG ratios.

Differentiated RPE cells were resistant to oxidative stress, and the expression of genes for protective proteins was highly increased by oxidative stress plus drug treatment. In mice treated with 8-OH-DPAT, the same genes (MT1, HO1, NqO1, Cat, Sod1) were induced in the neural retina, but the drug did not affect the expression of Sod2, the gene for manganese superoxide dismutase. We used a mouse strain deleted for Sod2 in the RPE to accelerate age-related oxidative stress in the retina and to test the impact of 8-OH-DPAT on the photoreceptor and RPE degeneration developed in these mice. Treatment of mice with daily injections of the drug led to increased electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes in dark-adapted mice and to a slight improvement in visual acuity. Most strikingly, in mice treated with a high dose of the drug (5\u00a0mg/kg) the structure of the RPE and Bruch's membrane and the normal architecture of photoreceptor outer segments were preserved.

IOP measurement and gonioscopic and fundic examinations provide the instruments for diagnosis of glaucoma. The primary goal in glaucoma therapy is aimed at vision preservation. Medical treatment provides temporary relief, but alone it fails to control IOP in the long term, and surgical intervention is recommended. Surgical patient selection depends on several factors, from type and stage of glaucoma to the presence of or potential for vision. Available surgical procedures to decrease IOP consist of cyclodestructive techniques to decrease aqueous humor production and filtering techniques to increase its drainage. Even with recent surgical and medical advances, pain and blindness are still common occurrences in the disease: end-stage procedures such as enucleation, evisceration with intrascleral prosthesis, and pharmacologic ablation of ciliary bodies are then recommended to address chronic discomfort for buphthalmic and blind globes.", "score": 2, "id": "26494500", "title": "Glaucomas."}, {"abstract": "<b>CASE DESCRIPTION: </b>5 cats from the same household were examined because of a sudden onset of tremors, obtundation, blindness, and dilated pupils.

Here we report a mutation in LTBP2 that causes primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) in domestic cats. We identified a spontaneous form of PCG in cats and established a breeding colony segregating for PCG consistent with fully penetrant, autosomal recessive inheritance of the trait. Elevated intraocular pressure, globe enlargement and elongated ciliary processes were consistently observed in all affected cats by 8 weeks of age. Varying degrees of optic nerve damage resulted by 6 months of age. Although subtle lens zonular instability was a common feature in this cohort, pronounced ectopia lentis was identified in less than 10% of cats examined. Thus, glaucoma in this pedigree is attributed to histologically confirmed arrest in the early post-natal development of the aqueous humor outflow pathways in the anterior segment of the eyes of affected animals. Using a candidate gene approach, significant linkage was established on cat chromosome B3 (LOD 18.38, \u03b8 = 0.00) using tightly linked short tandem repeat (STR) loci to the candidate gene, LTBP2. A 4 base-pair insertion was identified in exon 8 of LTBP2 in affected individuals that generates a frame shift that completely alters the downstream open reading frame and eliminates functional domains.

Here, we study whether parallel processing streams exist in mouse dLGN. We use a battery of stimuli that have been previously shown to successfully distinguish parallel streams in other species: electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm, contrast-reversing stationary gratings at varying spatial phase, drifting sinusoidal gratings, dense noise for receptive field reconstruction, and frozen contrast-modulating noise. As in the optic nerves of domestic cats and non-human primates, we find evidence for multiple conduction velocity groups after optic chiasm stimulation.

Here, we ask whether a simple contrast-encoding model predicts asymmetries for brights and darks that are similar to the asymmetries found in theONandOFFpathways. Importantly, this model does not include any explicit differences in how the visual system represents brights and darks, but it does include a common normalization mechanism. The phenomena captured by the model include (1) nonlinear contrast response functions, (2) greater nonlinearities in the responses to darks, and (3) larger responses to dark contrasts. We report a direct, quantitative comparison between these model predictions and previously published electrophysiological measurements from the retina and thalamus (guinea pig and cat, respectively).

VEGF-B, recently characterized, is reported to be expressed in retinal tissues, but the importance of VEGF-B to retinal vascular development remained unknown. The aim of this study was to analyse retinal vascular growth in the Vegfb-/- knockout mouse.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Retinal vascular growth was measured in Vegfb-/- knockout mice raised under normal conditions, and Vegfb-/- knockout mice with an oxygen-induced proliferative retinopathy. Wild type Vegfb+/+ mice served as controls. Vessels were perfused with ink and retinal flatmounts secondarily labelled with FITC-lectin (BS-1, Griffonia simplicifolia). Area and diameter of retinal growth and retinal vascular growth were recorded over days 0-20, and capillary density and mean diameter recorded from day 17 pups.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>A variety of techniques confirmed that Vegfb+/+ mice expressed VEGF-B and that VEGF-B expression was absent in Vegfb-/- mice. Vegfb-/- mice raised in room air showed no significant differences from Vegfb+/+ controls. No differences were found in oxygen-induced retinopathy between Vegfb-/- and Vegfb+/+ pups in either the extent of the initial oxygen-induced ablation, or in the regrowth of retinal vessels or vitreal (neovascular) sprouts; vitreal sprouts are important markers of the abnormal proliferative response, and are maximally expressed on day 17 in this model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>These results indicate that a lack of VEGF-B does not significantly affect development of the retinal vasculature under normal conditions, nor does it appear to affect the proliferative retinal responses seen in oxygen-induced retinopathy.<br/>", "score": 12, "id": "12580897", "title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor-B and retinal vascular development in the mouse."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide on the alterations in retinal gene expression in a rat model of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).<br/><b>METHODS: </b>In one eye of adult Brown Norway rats (n = 77) CRVO was induced with laser photocoagulation of all retinal veins near to the optic disk after intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml of 10% sodium fluorescein.

VEGFC induced proliferation, migration, sprouting and tube formation of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs) and these responses require CREB-mediated DLL4 expression and NOTCH1 activation. Furthermore, down regulation of VEGFC levels substantially reduced tip cell formation and retinal neovascularization in vivo. In addition, we observed that CREB via modulating the DLL4-NOTCH1 signaling mediates VEGFC-induced tip cell formation and retinal neovascularization. In regard to upstream mechanism, we found that down regulation of p38\u03b2 levels inhibited hypoxia-induced CREB-DLL4-NOTCH1 activation, tip cell formation, sprouting and retinal neovascularization.

In the present study, we explored this issue by examining functional effects of CaBP4 on heterologously expressed Cav1.4. We show that CaBP4 dramatically increases Cav1.4 channel availability. This effect crucially depends on the presence of the C-terminal ICDI (inhibitor of Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation) domain of Cav1.4 and is absent in a Cav1.4 mutant lacking the ICDI. Using FRET experiments, we demonstrate that CaBP4 interacts with the IQ motif of Cav1.4 and that it interferes with the binding of the ICDI domain. Based on these findings, we suggest that CaBP4 increases Cav1.4 channel availability by relieving the inhibitory effects of the ICDI domain on voltage-dependent Cav1.4 channel gating. We also functionally characterized two CaBP4 mutants that are associated with a congenital variant of human night blindness and other closely related nonstationary retinal diseases. Although both mutants interact with Cav1.4 channels, the functional effects of CaBP4 mutants are only partially preserved, leading to a reduction of Cav1.4 channel availability and loss of function.

Sequence alterations in CACNA1F lead to the incomplete type of CSNB (CSNB2), which can be distinguished by standard electroretinography (ERG). CSNB2 is associated with a reduced rod b-wave, a substantially reduced cone a-wave, and a reduced 30-Hz flicker ERG response. CACNA1F encodes the alpha 1-subunit of an L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.4 alpha ), which is specific to photoreceptors and is present at high density in the synaptic terminals. Ten of our patients with CSNB2 showed no mutation in CACNA1F. To identify the disease-causing mutations, we used a candidate-gene approach. CABP4, a member of the calcium-binding protein (CABP) family, is located in photoreceptor synaptic terminals and is directly associated with the C-terminal domain of the Cav1.4 alpha . Mice lacking either Cabp4 or Cav1.4 alpha display a CSNB2-like phenotype. Here, we report for the first time that mutations in CABP4 lead to autosomal recessive CSNB. Our studies revealed homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in two families. We also show that these mutations reduce the transcript levels to 30%-40% of those in controls.

Previously, we showed that CaBP4 directly regulates Ca(v)1 L-type Ca2+ channels, which are essential for normal photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Here, we show that the function of CaBP4 is regulated by phosphorylation. CaBP4 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C zeta (PKCzeta) at serine 37 both in vitro and in the retina and colocalizes with PKCzeta in photoreceptors. CaBP4 phosphorylation is greater in light-adapted than dark-adapted mouse retinas. In electrophysiological recordings of cells transfected with Ca(v)1.3 and CaBP4, mutation of the serine 37 to alanine abolished the effect of CaBP4 in prolonging the Ca2+ current through Ca(v)1.3 channel, whereas inactivating mutations in the CaBP4 Ca2+-binding sites strengthened Ca(v)1.3 modulation.

Central to their role in this regard, Ca(v)1.3 channels in inner hair cells show little Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation, a fast negative feedback regulation by incoming Ca(2+) ions, which depends on calmodulin association with the Ca(2+) channel alpha(1) subunit. Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation characterizes nearly all voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels including Ca(v)1.3 in other excitable cells. The mechanism underlying the limited autoregulation of Ca(v)1.3 in inner hair cells remains a mystery. Previously, we established calmodulin-like Ca(2+)-binding proteins in the brain and retina (CaBPs) as essential modulators of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. Here, we demonstrate that CaBPs differentially modify Ca(2+) feedback to Ca(v)1.3 channels in transfected cells and explore their significance for Ca(v)1.3 regulation in inner hair cells. Of multiple CaBPs detected in inner hair cells (CaBP1, CaBP2, CaBP4 and CaBP5), CaBP1 most efficiently blunts Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of Ca(v)1.3. CaBP1 and CaBP4 both interact with calmodulin-binding sequences in Ca(v)1.3, but CaBP4 more weakly inhibits Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation than CaBP1. Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation is marginally greater in inner hair cells from CaBP4(-/-) than from wild-type mice, yet CaBP4(-/-) mice are not hearing-impaired. In contrast to CaBP4, CaBP1 is strongly localized at the presynaptic ribbon synapse of adult inner hair cells both in wild-type and CaBP4(-/-) mice and therefore is positioned to modulate native Ca(v)1.3 channels.

Identified genes include CAPN5, TREX1, and TNFAIP3; Beh\u00e7et's disease is a systemic illness that is very commonly associated with occlusive retinal vasculitis; retinal imaging, including fluorescein angiography and other newer imaging modalities, has proven crucial to the identification and characterization of retinal vasculitis and its complications; although monoclonal antibodies to interleukin-17A or interleukin-1 beta failed in trials for Beh\u00e7et's disease, antibodies to TNF-alpha, either infliximab or adalimumab, have demonstrated consistent benefit in managing this disease. Interferon treatment and B-cell depletion therapy via rituximab may be beneficial in certain types of retinal vasculitis.<br/><b>SUMMARY: </b>Retinal vasculitis is an important entity for rheumatologists to understand.

In homology modeling with other calpains, this R243L CAPN5 mutation was situated in a mobile loop that gates substrate access to the calcium-regulated active site. In in vitro activity assays, the mutation increased calpain protease activity and made it far more active at low concentrations of calcium. To test whether the disease allele could yield an animal model of ADNIV, we created transgenic mice expressing human (h) CAPN5(R243L) only in the retina. The resulting hCAPN5(R243L) transgenic mice developed a phenotype consistent with human uveitis and ADNIV, at the clinical, histological and molecular levels. The fundus of hCAPN5(R243L) mice showed enhanced autofluorescence (AF) and pigment changes indicative of reactive retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptor degeneration. Electroretinography showed mutant mouse eyes had a selective loss of the b-wave indicating an inner-retina signaling defect. Histological analysis of mutant mouse eyes showed protein extravasation from dilated vessels into the anterior chamber and vitreous, vitreous inflammation, vitreous and retinal fibrosis and retinal degeneration. Analysis of gene expression changes in the hCAPN5(R243L) mouse retina showed upregulation of several markers, including members of the Toll-like receptor pathway, chemokines and cytokines, indicative of both an innate and adaptive immune response.

To explore the mechanism of ADNIV, a human CAPN5 disease allele was expressed in mouse retinas with a lentiviral vector created to express either the wild-type human (h) CAPN5 or the ADNIV mutant hCAPN5-R243L allele under a rhodopsin promoter with tandem green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Vectors were injected into the subretinal space of perinatal mice. Mouse phenotypes were analyzed using electroretinography, histology and inflammatory gene expression profiling. Mouse calpain-5 showed high homology to its human ortholog with >98% sequence identity that includes the ADNIV mutant residue. Calpain-5 protein was expressed in the inner and outer segments of the photoreceptors and in the outer plexiform layer. Expression of the hCAPN5-R243L allele caused loss of the electroretinogram b-wave, photoreceptor degeneration and induction of immune cell infiltration and inflammatory genes in the retina, recapitulating major features of the ADNIV phenotype. Intraocular neovascularization and fibrosis were not observed during the study period. Our study shows that expression of the hCAPN5-R243L disease allele elicits an ADNIV-like disease in mice. It further suggests that ADNIV is due to CAPN5 gain-of-function rather than haploinsufficiency, and retinal expression may be sufficient to generate an autoimmune response. Genetic models of ADNIV in the mouse can be used to explore protease mechanisms in retinal degeneration and inflammation as well as preclinical therapeutic testing.", "score": 5, "id": "24381307", "title": "Functional validation of a human CAPN5 exome variant by lentiviral transduction into mouse retina."}, {"abstract": "CAPN5 mutations have been linked to autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV), a blinding autoimmune eye disease. Here, we link a new CAPN5 mutation to ADNIV and model the three-dimensional structure of the resulting mutant protein.

Two daughters of an affected mother demonstrated symptoms of stage III ADNIV, with posterior uveitis, cystoid macular edema, intraocular fibrosis, retinal neovascularization, retinal degeneration, and cataract. The women also harbored a novel guanine to thymine (c.750G>T, p.Lys250Asn) missense mutation in exon 6 of CAPN5, a gene that encodes a calcium-activated cysteine protease, calpain-5. Modeling based on the structures of all known calpains revealed the mutation falls within a calcium-sensitive flexible gating loop that controls access to the catalytic groove. Three-dimensional modeling placed the new mutation in a region adjacent to two previously identified disease-causing mutations, all three of which likely disrupt hydrogen bonding within the gating loop, yielding a CAPN5 with altered enzymatic activity. This is the third case of a CAPN5 mutation leading to inherited uveitis and neovascular vitreoretinopathy, suggesting patients with ADNIV features should be tested for CAPN5 mutations.

Freshly prepared RPE/choroid and RPE samples were isolated from human donor eyes. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry were used to determine survival factor gene expression, cellular protein levels, and localization, respectively.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Multiple survival factor genes, including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (c-IAP1), c-IAP2, TNF receptor-associated factor-1 (TRAF-1), TRAF-2, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-x, A1, and cellular Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), were expressed in basal conditions in both cultured RPE cells and RPE cells in situ, whereas survivin was expressed only by cultured cells. TNF-alpha upregulated expression of TRAF-1, TRAF-2, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, c-FLIP, and A1. TRAF-1, c-FLIP, and to a lesser extent c-IAP2 protein levels were increased by TNF-alpha in a time-dependent manner, whereas c-IAP1, survivin, Bcl-x(L), and TRAF-2 protein levels were not influenced by TNF-alpha treatment at any time point tested. In contrast, Bcl-2 and A1 proteins were not detected under basal conditions or after TNF-alpha treatment. Overexpression of mutant IkappaB blocked TNF-alpha-induced TRAF-1, TRAF-2, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, c-FLIP, and A1 gene expression and downregulated TRAF-1 protein levels.

Other reported features include polydactyly, renal, liver and retinal involvement. To date, mutations in IFT80, DYNC2H1, TTC21B and WDR19 have been reported in ATD. The clinical and molecular heterogeneity leads to difficulties in the evaluation of the long-term prognosis.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>We investigated 53 ATD cases (23 living cases and 30 fetuses) from 39 families. They benefited from a combined approach of deep phenotyping and IFT80 and DYNC2H1 molecular screening.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Among the 23 postnatal cases, pulmonary insufficiency was noted in 60% of cases, with tracheotomy requirement in five cases. Renal and liver diseases occurred respectively in 17% and 22% of cases, whereas retinal alteration was present in 50% of cases aged more than 5 years. We identified DYNC2H1 mutations in 23 families (59%) and IFT80 mutations in two families (5%). However, in six families, only one heterozygote mutation in either IFT80 or DYNC2H1 was identified.

The presence of only one mutation in six families and the exclusion of the two genes in 14 families support the involvement of other causal cilia genes.

In addition, 21 missense mutations were distributed across DYNC2H1 and these showed some clustering to functional domains, especially the ATP motor domain. DYNC2H1 patients largely lacked significant extra-skeletal involvement, demonstrating an important genotype-phenotype correlation in JATD. Significant variability exists in the course and severity of the thoracic phenotype, both between affected siblings with identical DYNC2H1 alleles and among individuals with different alleles, which suggests the DYNC2H1 phenotype might be subject to modifier alleles, non-genetic or epigenetic factors.

All six IFT-A components and their motor protein, DYNC2H1, have been linked to human skeletal ciliopathies, including asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD; also known as Jeune syndrome), Sensenbrenner syndrome, and Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS). Conversely, the 14 subunits in the IFT-B module, with the exception of IFT80, have unknown roles in human disease. To identify additional IFT-B components defective in ciliopathies, we independently performed different mutation analyses: candidate-based sequencing of all IFT-B-encoding genes in 1,467 individuals with a nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy or whole-exome resequencing in 63 individuals with ATD. We thereby detected biallelic mutations in the IFT-B-encoding gene IFT172 in 12 families. All affected individuals displayed abnormalities of the thorax and/or long bones, as well as renal, hepatic, or retinal involvement, consistent with the diagnosis of ATD or MZSDS. Additionally, cerebellar aplasia or hypoplasia characteristic of Joubert syndrome was present in 2 out of 12 families. Fibroblasts from affected individuals showed disturbed ciliary composition, suggesting alteration of ciliary transport and signaling. Knockdown of ift172 in zebrafish recapitulated the human phenotype and demonstrated a genetic interaction between ift172 and ift80.

retinoblastoma. Children who inherit one defective copy of the RB1 gene have an increased susceptibility to retinoblastoma. Several years after the identification of the human RB1 gene, a targeted deletion of Rb was generated in mice. Mice with one defective copy of the Rb gene do not develop retinoblastoma. In this manuscript, we explore the different roles of the Rb family in human and mouse retinal development in order to better understand the species-specific difference in retinoblastoma susceptibility.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>We found that the Rb family of proteins (Rb, p107 and p130) are expressed in a dynamic manner during mouse retinal development. The primary Rb family member expressed in proliferating embryonic retinal progenitor cells in mice is p107, which is required for appropriate cell cycle exit during retinogenesis. The primary Rb family member expressed in proliferating postnatal retinal progenitor cells is Rb. p130 protein is expressed redundantly with Rb in postmitotic cells of the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina. When Rb is inactivated in an acute or chronic manner during mouse retinal development, p107 is upregulated in a compensatory manner. Similarly, when p107 is inactivated in the mouse retina, Rb is upregulated. No changes in p130 expression were seen when p107, Rb or both were inactivated in the developing mouse retina. In the human retina, RB1 was the primary family member expressed throughout development. There was very little if any p107 expressed in the developing human retina. In contrast to the developing mouse retina, when RB1 was acutely inactivated in the developing human fetal retina, p107 was not upregulated in a compensatory manner.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>We propose that intrinsic genetic compensation between Rb and p107 prevents retinoblastoma in Rb- or p107-deficient mice, but this compensation does not occur in humans. Together, these data suggest a model that explains why humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma following RB1 loss, but mice require both Rb and p107 gene inactivation.<br/>", "score": 13, "id": "16672052", "title": "Compensation by tumor suppressor genes during retinal development in mice and humans."}, {"abstract": "Certain cells of the human retina are extremely sensitive to loss of function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene RB. Retinoblastomas develop early in life and at high frequency in individuals heterozygous for a germ-line RB mutation, and sporadic retinoblastomas invariably have somatic mutation in the RB gene. In contrast, retinoblastomas do not develop in Rb+/- mice. Although retinoblastoma is thought to have developmental origins, the function of Rb in retinal development has not been fully characterized. Here we studied the role of Rb in normal retinal development and in retinoblastoma using conditional Rb mutations in the mouse. In late embryogenesis, Rb-deficient retinas exhibited ectopic S-phase and high levels of p53-independent apoptosis, particularly in the differentiating retinal ganglion cell layer. During postnatal retinal development, loss of Rb led to more widespread retinal apoptosis, and adults showed loss of photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Conditional Rb mutation in the retina did not result in retinoblastoma formation even in a p53-mutant background.

The retina, therefore, is an ideal location to assess other in vivo adenovirus E2 promoter binding factor (E2f) functions. It is thought that E2f1 directly induces apoptosis, whereas other activating E2fs only induce death indirectly by upregulating E2f1 expression. Indeed, mouse retinoblastoma (Rb)-null retinal neuron death requires E2f1, but not E2f2 or E2f3. However, we report an entirely distinct mechanism in dying cone photoreceptors. These neurons survive Rb loss, but undergo apoptosis in the cancer-prone retina lacking both Rb and its relative p107. We show that while E2f1 killed Rb/p107 null rod, bipolar and ganglion neurons, E2f2 was required and sufficient for cone death, independent of E2f1 and E2f3. Moreover, whereas E2f1-dependent apoptosis was p53 and p73-independent, E2f2 caused p53-dependent cone death.

Retinoblastomas were found in five out of seven adult pRb/p107-deficient chimeras. The retinal tumors showed amacrine cell differentiation, and therefore originated from cells committed to the inner but not the outer nuclear layer.

This tropism suggests that retinal cell-type-specific circuitry sensitizes to Rb loss, yet the nature of the circuitry and the cell type in which it operates have been unclear. Here we show that post-mitotic human cone precursors are uniquely sensitive to Rb depletion. Rb knockdown induced cone precursor proliferation in prospectively isolated populations and in intact retina. Proliferation followed the induction of E2F-regulated genes, and depended on factors having strong expression in maturing cone precursors and crucial roles in retinoblastoma cell proliferation, including MYCN and MDM2. Proliferation of Rb-depleted cones and retinoblastoma cells also depended on the Rb-related protein p107, SKP2, and a p27 downregulation associated with cone precursor maturation. Moreover, Rb-depleted cone precursors formed tumours in orthotopic xenografts with histological features and protein expression typical of human retinoblastoma.

Indeed, we show that Rb/p107 loss does not affect progenitor proliferation or precursor specification, but perturbs cell cycle exit in all seven retinal precursors. However, three precursors survive Rb/p107-loss and stop proliferating following terminal differentiation. Tumors arise from precursors that escape this delayed growth arrest.

Children who inherit one defective copy of the RB1 gene have an increased susceptibility to retinoblastoma. Several years after the identification of the human RB1 gene, a targeted deletion of Rb was generated in mice. Mice with one defective copy of the Rb gene do not develop retinoblastoma. In this manuscript, we explore the different roles of the Rb family in human and mouse retinal development in order to better understand the species-specific difference in retinoblastoma susceptibility.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>We found that the Rb family of proteins (Rb, p107 and p130) are expressed in a dynamic manner during mouse retinal development. The primary Rb family member expressed in proliferating embryonic retinal progenitor cells in mice is p107, which is required for appropriate cell cycle exit during retinogenesis. The primary Rb family member expressed in proliferating postnatal retinal progenitor cells is Rb. p130 protein is expressed redundantly with Rb in postmitotic cells of the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina. When Rb is inactivated in an acute or chronic manner during mouse retinal development, p107 is upregulated in a compensatory manner. Similarly, when p107 is inactivated in the mouse retina, Rb is upregulated. No changes in p130 expression were seen when p107, Rb or both were inactivated in the developing mouse retina. In the human retina, RB1 was the primary family member expressed throughout development. There was very little if any p107 expressed in the developing human retina. In contrast to the developing mouse retina, when RB1 was acutely inactivated in the developing human fetal retina, p107 was not upregulated in a compensatory manner.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>We propose that intrinsic genetic compensation between Rb and p107 prevents retinoblastoma in Rb- or p107-deficient mice, but this compensation does not occur in humans. Together, these data suggest a model that explains why humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma following RB1 loss, but mice require both Rb and p107 gene inactivation.<br/>", "score": 13, "id": "16672052", "title": "Compensation by tumor suppressor genes during retinal development in mice and humans."}, {"abstract": "Certain cells of the human retina are extremely sensitive to loss of function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene RB. Retinoblastomas develop early in life and at high frequency in individuals heterozygous for a germ-line RB mutation, and sporadic retinoblastomas invariably have somatic mutation in the RB gene. In contrast, retinoblastomas do not develop in Rb+/- mice. Although retinoblastoma is thought to have developmental origins, the function of Rb in retinal development has not been fully characterized. Here we studied the role of Rb in normal retinal development and in retinoblastoma using conditional Rb mutations in the mouse. In late embryogenesis, Rb-deficient retinas exhibited ectopic S-phase and high levels of p53-independent apoptosis, particularly in the differentiating retinal ganglion cell layer. During postnatal retinal development, loss of Rb led to more widespread retinal apoptosis, and adults showed loss of photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Conditional Rb mutation in the retina did not result in retinoblastoma formation even in a p53-mutant background.

It is thought that E2f1 directly induces apoptosis, whereas other activating E2fs only induce death indirectly by upregulating E2f1 expression. Indeed, mouse retinoblastoma (Rb)-null retinal neuron death requires E2f1, but not E2f2 or E2f3. However, we report an entirely distinct mechanism in dying cone photoreceptors. These neurons survive Rb loss, but undergo apoptosis in the cancer-prone retina lacking both Rb and its relative p107. We show that while E2f1 killed Rb/p107 null rod, bipolar and ganglion neurons, E2f2 was required and sufficient for cone death, independent of E2f1 and E2f3.

This tropism suggests that retinal cell-type-specific circuitry sensitizes to Rb loss, yet the nature of the circuitry and the cell type in which it operates have been unclear. Here we show that post-mitotic human cone precursors are uniquely sensitive to Rb depletion. Rb knockdown induced cone precursor proliferation in prospectively isolated populations and in intact retina. Proliferation followed the induction of E2F-regulated genes, and depended on factors having strong expression in maturing cone precursors and crucial roles in retinoblastoma cell proliferation, including MYCN and MDM2. Proliferation of Rb-depleted cones and retinoblastoma cells also depended on the Rb-related protein p107, SKP2, and a p27 downregulation associated with cone precursor maturation. Moreover, Rb-depleted cone precursors formed tumours in orthotopic xenografts with histological features and protein expression typical of human retinoblastoma.

However, three precursors survive Rb/p107-loss and stop proliferating following terminal differentiation. Tumors arise from precursors that escape this delayed growth arrest.

It is necessary that organelles double their size and divide to give rise to two identical daughter cells. Mitochondrial biogenesis occurs by growth and division of pre-existing organelles and is temporally coordinated with cell cycle events [1]. However, mitochondrial biogenesis is not only produced in association with cell division. It can be produced in response to an oxidative stimulus, to an increase in the energy requirements of the cells, to exercise training, to electrical stimulation, to hormones, during development, in certain mitochondrial diseases, etc. [2]. Mitochondrial biogenesis is therefore defined as the process via which cells increase their individual mitochondrial mass [3]. Recent discoveries have raised attention to mitochondrial biogenesis as a potential target to treat diseases which up to date do not have an efficient cure. Mitochondria, as the major ROS producer and the major antioxidant producer exert a crucial role within the cell mediating processes such as apoptosis, detoxification, Ca2+ buffering, etc. This pivotal role makes mitochondria a potential target to treat a great variety of diseases. Mitochondrial biogenesis can be pharmacologically manipulated. This issue tries to cover a number of approaches to treat several diseases through triggering mitochondrial biogenesis. It contains recent discoveries in this novel field, focusing on advanced mitochondrial therapies to chronic and degenerative diseases, mitochondrial diseases, lifespan extension, mitohormesis, intracellular signaling, new pharmacological targets and natural therapies. It contributes to the field by covering and gathering the scarcely reported pharmacological approaches in the novel and promising field of mitochondrial biogenesis. There are several diseases that have a mitochondrial origin such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and the Kearns- Sayre syndrome (KSS), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS), Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), the syndrome of neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), and Leigh's syndrome. Likewise, other diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a very important role include neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes or cancer. Generally, in mitochondrial diseases a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA leads to a loss of functionality of the OXPHOS system and thus to a depletion of ATP and overproduction of ROS, which can, in turn, induce further mtDNA mutations. The work by Yu-Ting Wu, Shi-Bei Wu, and Yau-Huei Wei (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan) [4] focuses on the aforementioned mitochondrial diseases with special attention to the compensatory mechanisms that prompt mitochondria to produce more energy even under mitochondrial defect-conditions. These compensatory mechanisms include the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes, mitochondrial biogenesis and overexpression of respiratory complex subunits, as well as metabolic shift to glycolysis. The pathways observed to be related to mitochondrial biogenesis as a compensatory adaptation to the energetic deficits in mitochondrial diseases are described (PGC- 1, Sirtuins, AMPK). Several pharmacological strategies to trigger these signaling cascades, according to these authors, are the use of bezafibrate to activate the PPAR-PGC-1\u03b1 axis, the activation of AMPK by resveratrol and the use of Sirt1 agonists such as quercetin or resveratrol. Other strategies currently used include the addition of antioxidant supplements to the diet (dietary supplementation with antioxidants) such as L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10,MitoQ10 and other mitochondria-targeted antioxidants,N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vitamin C, vitamin E vitamin K1, vitamin B, sodium pyruvate or -lipoic acid. As aforementioned, other diseases do not have exclusively a mitochondrial origin but they might have an important mitochondrial component both on their onset and on their development. This is the case of type 2 diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by a peripheral insulin resistance accompanied by an increased secretion of insulin as a compensatory system. Among the explanations about the origin of insulin resistance M\u00f3nica Zamora and Josep A. Villena (Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra / Laboratory of Metabolism and Obesity, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain) [5] consider the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction, e.g. impaired (mitochondrial) oxidative capacity of the cell or tissue, is one of the main underlying causes of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although this hypothesis is not free of controversy due to the uncertainty on the sequence of events during type 2 diabetes onset, e.g. whether mitochondrial dysfunction is the cause or the consequence of insulin resistance, it has been widely observed that improving mitochondrial function also improves insulin sensitivity and prevents type 2 diabetes. Thus restoring oxidative capacity by increasing mitochondrial mass appears as a suitable strategy to treat insulin resistance. The effort made by researchers trying to understand the signaling pathways mediating mitochondrial biogenesis has uncovered new potential pharmacological targets and opens the perspectives for the design of suitable treatments for insulin resistance. In addition some of the current used strategies could be used to treat insulin resistance such as lifestyle interventions (caloric restriction and endurance exercise) and pharmacological interventions (thiazolidinediones and other PPAR agonists, resveratrol and other calorie restriction mimetics, AMPK activators, ERR activators). Mitochondrial biogenesis is of special importance in modern neurochemistry because of the broad spectrum of human diseases arising from defects in mitochondrial ion and ROS homeostasis, energy production and morphology [1]. Parkinson\u00b4s Disease (PD) is a very good example of this important mitochondrial component on neurodegenerative diseases. Anuradha Yadav, Swati Agrawal, Shashi Kant Tiwari, and Rajnish K. Chaturvedi (CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research / Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, India) [6] remark in their review the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD with special focus on the role of oxidative stress and bioenergetic deficits. These alterations may have their origin on pathogenic gene mutations in important genes such as DJ-1, -syn, parkin, PINK1 or LRRK2. These mutations, in turn, may cause defects in mitochondrial dynamics (key events like fission/fusion, biogenesis, trafficking in retrograde and anterograde directions, and mitophagy). This work reviews different strategies to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics in order to ameliorate the neurodegenerative process, with an emphasis on clinical trials reports that indicate their potential. Among them creatine, Coenzyme Q10 and mitochondrial targeted antioxidants/peptides are reported to have the most remarkable effects in clinical trials. They highlight a dual effect of PGC-1\u03b1 expression on PD prognosis. Whereas a modest expression of this transcriptional co-activator results in positive effects, a moderate to substantial overexpession may have deleterious consequences. As strategies to induce PGC-1\u03b1 activation, these authors remark the possibility to activate Sirt1 with resveratrol, to use PPAR agonists such as pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, fenofibrate and bezafibrate. Other strategies include the triggering of Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway by triterpenoids (derivatives of oleanolic acid) or by Bacopa monniera, the enhancement of ATP production by carnitine and -lipoic acid. Mitochondrial dysfunctions are the prime source of neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the context of neural differentiation, Martine Uittenbogaard and Anne Chiaramello (Department of Anatomy and Regenerative Biology, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, USA) [7] thoroughly describe the implication of mitochondrial biogenesis on neuronal differentiation, its timing, its regulation by specific signaling pathways and new potential therapeutic strategies. The maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis is crucial for neuronal development. A mitochondrial dynamic balance is necessary between mitochondrial fusion, fission and quality control systems and mitochondrial biogenesis. Concerning the signaling pathways leading to mitochondrial biogenesis this review highlights the implication of different regulators such as AMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, NRF1, NRF2, Tfam, etc. on the specific case of neuronal development, providing examples of diseases in which these pathways are altered and transgenic mouse models lacking these regulators. A common hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases (Huntington\u00b4s Disease, Alzheimer\u00b4s Disease and Parkinson\u00b4s Disease) is the impaired function or expression of PGC-1\u03b1, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Among the promising strategies to ameliorate mitochondrial-based diseases these authors highlight the induction of PGC-1\u03b1 via activation of PPAR receptors (rosiglitazone, bezafibrate) or modulating its activity by AMPK (AICAR, metformin, resveratrol) or SIRT1 (SRT1720 and several isoflavone-derived compounds). This article also presents a review of the current animal and cellular models useful to study mitochondriogenesis. Although it is known that many neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases are originated in mitochondria, the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis has never been extensively studied.

We used a comparative genomics approach using the mouse and human genomes to identify 390 genes that contained conserved Gli binding sites. RT-qPCR validation of 46 target genes in E14.5 and P0.5 retinal explants revealed that Hh pathway activation resulted in the modulation of 30 of these targets, 25 of which demonstrated a temporal regulation. Further validation revealed that the expression of Bok, FoxA1, Sox8 and Wnt7a was dependent upon Sonic Hh (Shh) signaling in the retina and their regulation is under positive and negative controls by Gli2 and Gli3, respectively. We also show using chromatin immunoprecipitation that Gli2 binds to the Sox8 promoter, suggesting that Sox8 is an Hh-dependent direct target of Gli2. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hh pathway also modulates the expression of Sox9 and Sox10, which together with Sox8 make up the SoxE group.

These nutrients are present in most infant formulas at modest levels, intended to support visual and neural development. There are no investigations in primates of the biological consequences of dietary DHA at levels above those present in formulas but within normal breastmilk levels.<br/><b>METHODS AND FINDINGS: </b>Twelve baboons were divided into three formula groups: Control, with no DHA-ARA; \"L\", LCPUFA, with 0.33%DHA-0.67%ARA; \"L3\", LCPUFA, with 1.00%DHA-0.67%ARA.

Mitochondrial fatty acid carrier, CPT2, was among several genes associated with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to be downregulated by high DHA, while the mitochondrial proton carrier, UCP2, was upregulated.

The effects were modelled with phasic magnocellar retinal ganglion cells. The changing L' versus M' contrast weights in the model predict that the temporal dynamics of the L' and M' luminance signals will differ on green and orange fields. This is assessed with several protocols. Motion thresholds for 1 cycle deg(-1) drifting gratings or static pulsed gratings on the orange field show that the M' signal is more temporally bandpass than the L' signal; this reverses on the green field. Strong motion due to the different dynamics of the L' and M' signals is even seen with a pair of L' and M' gratings pulsed simultaneously. Impulse response functions were measured with gratings pulsed spatially in phase or antiphase.

The human luminance (LUM) mechanism detects rapid flicker and motion, responding to a linear sum of contrast signals, L' and M', from the long-wave (L) and middle-wave (M) cones. The red-green mechanism detects hue variations, responding to a linear difference of L' and M' contrast signals. 2. The two detection mechanisms were isolated to assess how chromatic adaptation affects summation of L' and M' signals in each mechanism. On coloured background (from blue to red), we measured, as a function of temporal frequency, both the relative temporal phase of the L' and M' signals producing optimal summation and the relative L' and M' contrast weights of the signals (at the optimal phase for summation). 3. Within the red-green mechanism at 6 Hz, the phase shift between the L' and M' signals was negligible on each coloured field, and the L' and M' contrast weights were equal and of opposite sign. 4. Relative phase shifts between the L' and M' signals in the LUM mechanism were markedly affected by adapting field colour. For stimuli of 1 cycle deg-1 and 9 Hz, the temporal phase shift was zero on a green-yellow field (approximately 570 nm). On an orange field, the L' signal lagged M' by as much as 70 deg phase while on a green field M' lagged L' by as much as 70 deg. The asymmetric phase shift about yellow adaptation reveals a spectrally opponent process which controls the phase shift. The phase shift occurs at an early site, for colour adaptation of the other eye had no effect, and the phase shift measured monocularly was identical for flicker and motion, thus occurring before the motion signal is extracted (this requires an extra delay). 5. The L' versus M' phase shift in the LUM mechanism was generally greatest at intermediate temporal frequencies (4-12 Hz) and was small at high frequencies (20-25 Hz). The phase shift was greatest at low spatial frequencies and strongly reduced at high spatial frequencies (5 cycle deg-1), indicating that the receptive field surround of neurones is important for the phase shift. 6. These temporal phase shifts were confirmed by measuring motion contrast thresholds for drifting L cone and M cone gratings summed in different spatial phases. Owing to the large phase shifts on green or orange fields, the L and M components were detected about equally well by the LUM mechanism (at 1 cycle deg-1 and 9 Hz) when summed spatially in phase or in antiphase. Antiphase summation is typically thought to produce an equiluminant red-green grating. 7. At low spatial frequency, the relative L' and M' contrast weights in the LUM mechanism (assessed at the optimal phase for summation) changed strongly with field colour and temporal frequency. 8. The phase shifts and changing contrast weights were modelled with phasic retinal ganglion cells, with chromatic adaptation strongly modifying the receptive field surround. The cells summate L' and M' in their centre, while the surround L' and M' signals are both antagonistic to the centre for approximately 570 nm yellow adaptation. Green or orange adaptation is assumed to modify the L and M surround inputs, causing them to be opponent with respect to each other, but with reversed polarity on the green versus orange field (to explain the chromatic reversal of the phase shift). Large changes in the relative L' and M' weights on green versus orange fields indicate the clear presence of the spectrally opponent surround even at 20 Hz. The spectrally opponent surround appears sluggish, with a long delay (approximately 20 ms) relative to the centre.", "score": 1, "id": "9061652", "title": "Colour adaptation modifies the long-wave

"<b>BACKGROUND: </b>Cadherins are a superfamily of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules that play multiple roles in morphogenesis, including proliferation, migration, differentiation and cell-cell recognition. The subgroups of classic cadherins and delta-protocadherins are involved in processes of neural development, such as neurite outgrowth, pathfinding, target recognition, synaptogenesis as well as synaptic plasticity. We mapped the expression of 7 classic cadherins (CDH4, CDH6, CDH7, CDH8, CDH11, CDH14, CDH20) and 8 delta-protocadherins (PCDH1, PCDH7, PCDH8, PCDH9, PCDH10, PCDH11, PCDH17, PCDH18) at representative stages of retinal development and in the mature retina of the ferret by in situ hybridization.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>All cadherins investigated by us are expressed differentially by restricted populations of retinal cells during specific periods of the ferret retinogenesis. For example, during embryonic development, some cadherins are exclusively expressed in the outer, proliferative zone of the neuroblast layer, whereas other cadherins mark the prospective ganglion cell layer or cells in the prospective inner nuclear layer. These expression patterns anticipate histogenetic changes that become visible in Nissl or nuclear stainings at later stages. In parallel to the ongoing development of retinal circuits, cadherin expression becomes restricted to specific subpopulations of retinal cell types, especially of ganglion cells, which express most of the investigated cadherins until adulthood. A comparison to previous results in chicken and mouse reveals overall conserved expression patterns of some cadherins but also species differences.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The spatiotemporally restricted expression patterns of 7 classic cadherins and 8 delta-protocadherins indicate that cadherins provide a combinatorial adhesive code that specifies developing retinal cell populations and intraretinal as well as retinofugal neural circuits in the developing ferret retina.<br/>", "score": 8, "id": "20028529", "title": "Expression of classic cadherins and delta-protocadherins in the developing ferret retina."}, {"abstract": "In this study we analyzed expression patterns of two delta-protocadherins, protocadherin-9 and protocadherin-17, in the developing zebrafish using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR methods. Both protocadherins were mainly detected in the embryonic central nervous system, but each showed a distinct expression pattern. Protocadherin-9 message (Pcdh9) was expressed after 10h post fertilization (hpf). It was found mainly in small clusters of cells in the anteroventral forebrain and ventrolateral hindbrain, and scattered cells throughout the spinal cord of young embryos (24 hpf). Pcdh9 expression in the hindbrain was segmental, reflecting a neuromeric organization, which became more evident at 34 hpf. As development proceeded, Pcdh9 expression increased throughout the brain, while its expression in the spinal cord was greatly reduced. Pcdh9 was also found in the developing retina and statoacoustic ganglion. Protocadherin-17 message (Pcdh17) expression began much earlier (1.5-2 hpf) than Pcdh9. Similar to Pcdh9 expression, Pcdh17 expression was found mainly in the anteroventral forebrain at 24 hpf, but its expression in the hindbrain and spinal cord, confined mainly to lateroventral regions of the hindbrain and anterior spinal cord, was more restricted than Pcdh9.

Yeast two-hybrid screening of a bovine retinal cDNA library with the cytoplasmic domain of retinal insulin receptor identified a novel member of the Grb7 gene family, Grb14. Phosphorylation prediction software indicated 6 out of 18 tyrosine residues were most likely to be phosphorylated. Out of six tyrosine phosphorylation sites, one of the tyrosine residues in Grb14 is present in a conserved sequence motif, FXNPXY. The NPXY motifs are recognized by proteins containing a domain known as phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) or phosphotyrosine-interacting domain (PID). The biological function of the PTB domain is to drive recruitment of signaling adapters such as IRS-1 or Shc to NPXpY (pY stands for phosphotyrosine) on activated receptor tyrosine kinases. We have made a novel finding that the PTB domain of IRS-1 binds to the NPXY motif of Grb14 in a phosphorylation-independent manner. In addition, Grb14-IRS-1 complexes are detected in lysates prepared from retina tissues. We suggest that the Grb14 NPXY motif could be acting as a dominant negative for IRS-1 functions in the retina, and this hypothesis is consistent with the recent study that Grb14-deficient mice exhibit enhanced IRS-1 phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase B.

We also used retinal organ cultures to demonstrate insulin activation of the insulin receptor and subsequent binding of p85, measured through GST pull-down assays with p85 fusion proteins. Further, the Y960F mutant insulin receptor, which does not bind IRS-1, is capable of bringing down PI3K activity from retina lysates.

In three families, we observed a new syndrome that we called HANAC, for hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms and muscle cramps, which is associated with morphological alterations of cutaneous and renal basement membranes. This novel \"basalopathy\" is caused by glycine mutations in COL4A1 exons 24 and 25. We discuss phenotype-genotype correlations and the implications of the HANAC syndrome for the diagnosis of autosomal dominant hematuria, cystic kidney disease, intracranial aneurysms, and muscle cramps.", "score": 1, "id": "19238787", "title": "[Hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms and muscle cramps (HANAC): a new basement membrane-disease associated with mutations of the COL4A1 gene]."}, {"abstract": "<b>OBJECTIVE: </b>Several hereditary ischemic small-vessel diseases of the brain have been reported during the last decade.

The major isoform, alpha1.alpha1.alpha2(IV), contributes to the formation of many BMs and its deficiency causes embryonic lethality in mouse. We have identified an allelic series of three ENU induced dominant mouse mutants with missense mutations in the gene Col4a1 encoding the alpha1(IV) subunit chain. Two severe alleles (Bru and Svc) have mutations affecting the conserved glycine residues in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa collagen repeat. Bru heterozygous mice display defects similar to Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly, including iris defects, corneal opacity, vacuolar cataracts, significant iris/corneal adhesions, buphthalmos and optic nerve cupping, a sign indicative of glaucoma. Kidneys of Bru mice have peripheral glomerulopathy characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the parietal epithelium of Bowman's capsule. A milder allele (Raw) contains a mutation in the Yaa residue of the collagen repeat and was identified by a silvery appearance of the retinal arterioles. All phenotypes are associated with BM defects that affect the eye, kidney and other tissues. This allelic series shows that mutations affecting the collagen domain cause dominant negative effects on the expression and function of the major collagen IV isoform alpha1(IV), and pathological effects vary with the individual mutations.", "score": 1, "id": "16159887", "title": "Dominant mutations of Col4a1 result in basement membrane defects which lead to anterior segment dysgenesis and glomerulopathy."}, {"abstract": "In yeast, mitochondrial dysfunction activates a specific pathway, termed retrograde regulation, which alters the expression of specific nuclear genes and results in increased replicative life span. In mammalian cells, the specific nuclear genes induced in response to loss of mitochondrial function are less well defined. This study characterizes responses in nuclear gene expression to loss of mitochondrial DNA sequences in three different human cell types: T143B, an osteosarcoma-derived cell line; ARPE19, a retinal pigment epithelium cell line; and GMO6225, a fibroblast cell population from an individual with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS). Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure gene expression of a selection of glycolysis, TCA cycle, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, extracellular matrix, stress response, and regulatory genes. Gene expression changes that were common to all three cell types included up-regulation of GCK (glucokinase), CS (citrate synthase), HOX1 (heme oxygenase 1), CKMT2 (mitochondrial creatine kinase 2), MYC (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog), and WRN (Werner syndrome helicase), and down-regulation of FBP1 (fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1) and COL4A1 (collagen, type IV, alpha 1). RNA interference experiments show that induction of MYC is important in rho0 cells for the up-regulation of glycolysis. In addition, a variety of cell type-specific gene changes was detected and most likely depended upon the differentiated functions of the individual cell types. These expression changes may help explain the response of different tissues to the loss of mitochondrial function due to aging or disease.", "score": 1, "id": "15561107", "title": "Common and cell

Dr. Curin performed a vast range of ophthalmologic surgeries for cataract, glaucoma, strabismus, oculoplastic surgery, dacryocystectomy, retinal detachment, etc. Dr. Curin was also head of trachoma service he founded in 1923. He wrote a scientifically instructive booklet on trachoma and several other papers. From 1923 till 1935, he was the only ophthalmologist in Split.

The toxic ocular events following sulfur mustard exposure are characterized by several stages: photophobia starting a few hours after exposure, an acute injury phase characterized by inflammation of the anterior segment and corneal erosions and a delayed phase appearing following a clinically silent period (years in human). The late injury appeared in part of the exposed eyes, expressed by epithelial defects and corneal neovascularization (NV), that lead to vision deficits and even blindness. During the last years we have characterized the temporal development of ocular lesions following SM vapor exposure in rabbits and have shown the existence of two sub-populations of corneas, those exhibiting delayed ocular lesions (clinically impaired) and those exhibiting only minor injuries if at all (clinically non-impaired). The aim of the present study was to investigate the pathological mechanism underlying the delayed injury by focusing on the unique characteristics of each sub-population and to test the efficacy of potential treatments. Clinically impaired corneas were characterized by chronic inflammation, increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, poor innervation and limbal damage. Moreover, using impression cytology and histology, we identified the delayed lesions as typical for an ocular surface disorder under the category of limbal epithelial stem cell deficiency (LSCD). These results point to therapeutic directions, using anti-inflammatory drugs, MMPs inhibitors, neurotrophic factors and amniotic membrane transplantation. Topical anti-inflammatory drugs, either steroid (Dexamycin, DEX) or non-steroidal anti-infllammatory drug (NSAID, Voltaren Ophtha) were found to be beneficial in ameliorating the initial inflammatory response and in postponing the development of corneal NV, when given during the first week after exposure. When DEX was administered as a symptomatic treatment against NV, a significant regression in the angiogenic process was observed, however, the effect was temporal and blood vessels reappeared after therapy ceased. Chronic administration (8 weeks) of the MMP inhibitor Doxycycline was also effective in attenuation of the acute and delayed injury. Preliminary results, using amniotic membrane transplantation revealed some decrease of corneal edema with no effect on corneal NV. It is suggested that the chronic inflammation and prolonged impairment of corneal innervation are playing a role in the pathogenesis of the delayed LSCD following SM exposure by creating a pathological microenvironment to limbal epithelial stem cells, thus, leading to their slow death and to a second cascade of pathological events eventually resulting in severe long-term injuries. As of today, only topical anti-inflammatory drugs reached the criteria of an applicable efficient post-exposure ocular treatment for SM injuries. Further studies are required to investigate the effects of SM on epithelial stem cells and their involvement in the pathogenesis of the long-term injuries.", "score": 1, "id": "19061933", "title": "Ocular injuries following sulfur mustard exposure--pathological mechanism and potential therapy."}, {"abstract": "<b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To report the visual and anatomic outcomes as well as to predict the visual prognosis of combat ocular trauma (COT) during Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom.<br/><b>DESIGN: </b>Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series.<br/><b>PARTICIPANTS: </b>Five hundred twenty-three consecutive globe or adnexal combat injuries, or both, sustained by 387 United States soldiers treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center between March 2003 and October 2006.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Two hundred one ocular trauma variables were collected on each injured soldier.

With this goal mostly achieved, discussion of etiological factors should be reintroduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). A research agenda for the DSM-V advocated the \"development of a pathophysiologically based classification system\". The author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala-driven, species-atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans. Over 30 empirically testable/falsifiable predictions are presented. It is noted that in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10, the classification of stress and fear circuitry disorders is neither mode-of-acquisition-based nor brain-evolution-based. For example, snake phobia (innate) and dog phobia (overconsolidational) are clustered together. Similarly, research on blood-injection-injury-type-specific phobia clusters two fears different in their innateness: 1) an arguably ontogenetic memory-trace-overconsolidation-based fear (hospital phobia) and 2) a hardwired (innate) fear of the sight of one's blood or a sharp object penetrating one's skin. Genetic architecture-charting of fear-circuitry-related traits has been challenging. Various, non-phenotype-based architectures can serve as targets for research. In this article, the author will propose one such alternative genetic architecture. This article was inspired by the following: A) Nesse's \"Smoke-Detector Principle\", B) the increasing suspicion that the \"smooth\" rather than \"lumpy\" distribution of complex psychiatric phenotypes (including fear-circuitry disorders) may in some cases be accounted for by oligogenic (and not necessarily polygenic) transmission, and C) insights from the initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium published in late 2005. Neuroevolutionary insights relevant to fear circuitry symptoms that primarily emerge overconsolidationally (especially Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) are presented. Also introduced is a human-evolution-based principle for clustering innate fear traits. The \"Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle\" of innate fears proposed in this article may be useful in the development of a neuroevolution-based taxonomic re-clustering of stress-triggered and fear-circuitry disorders in DSM-V. Four broad clusters of evolved fear circuits are proposed based on their time-depths: 1) Mesozoic (mammalian-wide) circuits hardwired by wild-type alleles driven to fixation by Mesozoic selective sweeps; 2) Cenozoic (simian-wide) circuits relevant to many specific phobias; 3) mid Paleolithic and upper Paleolithic (Homo sapiens-specific) circuits (arguably resulting mostly from mate-choice-driven stabilizing selection); 4) Neolithic circuits (arguably mostly related to stabilizing selection driven by gene-culture co-evolution). More importantly, the author presents evolutionary perspectives on warzone-related PTSD, Combat-Stress Reaction, Combat-related Stress, Operational-Stress, and other deployment-stress-induced symptoms. The Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle presented in this article may help explain the dissimilar stress-resilience levels following different types of acute threat to survival of oneself or one's progency (aka DSM-III and DSM-V PTSD Criterion-A events). PTSD rates following exposure to lethal inter-group violence (combat, warzone exposure or intentionally caused disasters such as terrorism) are usually 5-10 times higher than rates following large-scale natural disasters such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. The author predicts that both intentionally-caused large-scale bioevent-disasters, as well as natural bioevents such as SARS and avian flu pandemics will be an exception and are likely to be followed by PTSD rates approaching those that follow warzone exposure. During bioevents, Amygdala-driven and locus-coeruleus-driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection-caused cytokine-driven symptoms. Implications for the red cross and FEMA are discussed. It is also argued that hospital phobia as well as dog phobia, bird phobia and bat phobia require re-taxonomization in DSM-V in a new \"overconsolidational disorders\" category anchored around PTSD. The overconsolidational spectrum category may be conceptualized as straddling the fear circuitry spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders categories, and may be a category for which Pitman's secondary prevention propranolol regimen may be specifically indicated as a \"morning after pill\" intervention. Predictions are presented regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (e.g., female-pattern hoarding vs. male-pattern hoarding) and \"culture-bound\" acute anxiety symptoms (taijin-kyofusho, koro, shuk yang, shook yong, suo yang, rok-joo, jinjinia-bemar, karoshi, gwarosa, Voodoo death). Also discussed are insights relevant to pseudoneurological symptoms and to the forthcoming Dissociative-Conversive disorders category in DSM-V, including what the author terms fright-triggered acute pseudo-localized symptoms (i.e., pseudoparalysis, pseudocerebellar imbalance, psychogenic blindness, pseudoseizures, and epidemic sociogenic illness). Speculations based on studies of the human abnormal-spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene, the microcephaly primary autosomal recessive (MCPH) gene, and the forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) gene are made and incorporated into what is termed \"The pre-FOXP2 Hypothesis of Blood-Injection-Injury Phobia.\" Finally, the author argues for a non-reductionistic fusion of \"distal (evolutionary) neurobiology\" with clinical \"proximal neurobiology,\" utilizing neurological heuristics. It is noted that the value of re-clustering fear traits based on behavioral ethology, human-phylogenomics-derived endophenotypes and on ontogenomics (gene-environment interactions) can be confirmed or disconfirmed using epidemiological or twin studies and psychiatric genomics.", "score": 1, "id": "16563589", "title": "Human brain evolution and the \"Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:\" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder."}, {"abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND: </b>To describe surgical management and establish anatomic and visual results of patients with explosive ocular trauma in terrorist attacks treated with extreme vitreoretinal surgery.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Retrospective study of clinical records (6-month follow-up) of patients with visual acuity (VA) of light perception or better with posterior segment injuries [vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment (RD), intra-ocular foreign bodies (IOFB), perforating trauma (PT)] from explosive weapons who underwent vitreoretinal surgery.

We posit that conversion disorders are etiologically related to specific evolutionary pressures (inescapable threats to life) in the late stage of the human environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA). Bracha et al. have recently argued that from the neuroevolutionary perspective, medically unexplained efferent vasovagal syncope and medically unexplained craniofacial musculoskeletal pain in young otherwise healthy individuals, may be taxonomized as stress and fear-circuitry disorders. In the present article, we extend neuroevolutionary perspectives to acute pseudoneurological sociogenic (\"conversive\") symptoms: psychogenic non-epileptic attacks (\"pseudoseizures\"), epidemic sociogenic disorders (DSM-IV-TR Epidemic \"Hysteria\"), conversive motor deficits (pseudo-paralysis and pseudo-cerebellar symptoms), and psychogenic blindness. We hypothesize that these perplexing pseudoneurological stress-triggered symptoms, which constitute psychopathology in extant humans, are traceable to allele-variant polymorphisms which spread during the Neolithic EEA. During Neolithic warfare, conversive symptoms may have increased the survival odds for some non-combatants by visually (i.e., \"non-verbally\") signaling to predatory conspecifics that one does not present a danger. This is consistent with the age and sex pattern of conversive disorders. Testable and falsifiable predictions are presented; e.g., at the genome-transcriptome interface, one of the major oligogenic loci involved in conversive spectrum disorders may carry a developmentally sensitive allele in a stable polymorphism (balanced polymorphism) in which the gene expression mechanism is gradually suppressed by pleiotropic androgens especially dehydroxyepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S).

Variola virus, the cause of smallpox, and vaccinia virus, used in smallpox immunization, are both orthopoxviruses that are associated with serious ocular complications, including eyelid and conjunctival infection, corneal ulceration, disciform keratitis, iritis, optic neuritis, and blindness. About 5% to 9% of patients with smallpox develop ocular complications, and case-fatality rates reach 20% to 35% among unvaccinated individuals. About 10 to 20 patients develop ocular complications per 1 million smallpox immunizations, usually through autoinoculation, in which the patient transfers vaccinia from the immunization site to the eye. The risk of ocular vaccinia infection may be reduced by instructing patients and individuals in close contact with the vaccinee to wash their hands often and avoid touching the immunization site and their eyes. Topical antiviral therapy, topical steroids, and topical and oral antibiotics have been used to reduce the ocular complications of smallpox immunization.

The 21st century continues to see patterns of children enmeshed in international violence between opposing combatant forces, as victims of terrorist warfare, and, perhaps most tragically of all, as victims of civil wars. Innocent children so often are the victims of high-energy wounding from military ordinance. They sustain high-energy tissue damage and massive burns - injuries that are not commonly seen in civilian populations. Children have also been deliberately targeted victims in genocidal civil wars in Africa in the past decade, and hundreds of thousands have been killed and maimed in the context of close-quarter, hand-to-hand assaults of great ferocity. Paediatricians serve as uniformed military surgeons and as civilian doctors in both international and civil wars, and have a significant strategic role to play as advocates for the rights and welfare of children in the context of the evolving 'Laws of War'. One chronic legacy of contemporary warfare is blast injury to children from landmines. Such blasts leave children without feet or lower limbs, with genital injuries, blindness and deafness. This pattern of injury has become one of the post-civil war syndromes encountered by all intensivists and surgeons serving in four of the world's continents. The continued advocacy for the international ban on the manufacture, commerce and military use of antipersonnel landmines is a part of all paediatricians' obligation to promote the ethos of the Laws of War. Post-traumatic stress disorder remains an undertreated legacy of children who have been trapped in the shot and shell of battle as well as those displaced as refugees. An urgent, unfocused and unmet challenge has been the increase in, and plight of, child soldiers themselves. A new class of combatant comprises these children, who also become enmeshed in the triad of anarchic civil war, light-weight weaponry and drug or alcohol addiction. The International Criminal Court has outlawed as a War Crime, the conscription of children under 15 years of age. Nevertheless, there remain more than 300000 child soldiers active and enmeshed in psychopathic violence as part of both civil and international warfare. The typical profile of a child soldier is of a boy between the ages of 8 and 18 years, bonded into a group of armed peers, almost always an orphan, drug or alcohol addicted, amoral, merciless, illiterate and dangerous.

Monkeypox is endemic in central Africa, and the discontinuation of the vaccination (with vaccinia virus) has rendered most humans vulnerable to variola virus, the etiologic agent of smallpox, should this virus be used in biological warfare or terrorism. However, a large variety of compounds have been described that are potent inhibitors of vaccinia virus replication and could be expected to be active against other poxviruses as well. These compounds could be grouped in different classes: (i) IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors (e.g., EICAR); (ii) SAH hydrolase inhibitors (e.g., 5'-noraristeromycin, 3-deazaneplanocin A, and various neplanocin A derivatives); (iii) OMP decarboxylase inhibitors (e.g., pyrazofurin) and CTP synthetase inhibitors (e.g., cyclopentenyl cytosine); (iv) thymidylate synthase inhibitors (e.g., 5-substituted 2'-deoxyuridines); (v) nucleoside analogues that are targeted at viral DNA synthesis (e.g., Ara-A); (vi) acyclic nucleoside phosphonates [e.g., (S)-HPMPA and (S)-HPMPC (cidofovir)]; and (vii) polyanionic substances (e.g., polyacrylic acid). All these compounds could be considered potential candidate drugs for the therapy and prophylaxis of poxvirus infections at large. Some of these compounds, in particular polyacrylic acid and cidofovir, were found to generate, on single-dose administration, a long-lasting protective efficacy against vaccinia virus infection in vivo. Cidofovir, which has been approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in immunocompromised patients, was also found to protect mice, again when given as a single dose, against a lethal aerosolized or intranasal cowpox virus challenge. In a biological warfare scenario, it would be advantageous to be able to use a single treatment for an individual exposed to an aerosolized poxvirus. Cidofovir thus holds great promise for treating human smallpox, monkeypox, and other poxvirus infections.

These are antipersonnel mines which continue to injure people long after a ceasefire without differentiating between friend or foe, soldier or civilian, women or children. This study focuses on Afghan non-combatants engaged in mine clearing operations in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Russo-Afghan war. The patterns and types of injuries seen are described and experiences in their management, ways, and means to prevent them, and recommendations for the rehabilitation of the affected individuals are given.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>It is a retrospective and analytical study of 84 patients aged 19-56 years who sustained mine blast injuries during mine clearing operations in Afghanistan from November 1992 to January 1996. The study was carried out at a military hospital with tertiary care facilities. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of their injuries. Group 1 required only general surgical attention, group 2 sustained only ocular injuries, while group 3 had combined ocular and general injuries. Patients in groups 2 and 3 were treated in two phases. The first phase aimed at immediate restoration of the anatomy, while restoration of function wherever possible was done in subsequent surgical procedures in the second phase.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>It was observed that 51 out of 84 patients (60.7%) had sustained ocular trauma of a variable degree as a result of the blasts. The mean age of the victims was 29 years and they were all male. A total of 91 eyes of 51 patients (89.2%) had been damaged. Bilaterality of damage was seen in 40 (78.4%) patients. Most, 34 (37.3%), eyes became totally blind (NPL). Only a few escaped with injury mild enough not to impair vision. Foreign bodies, small and multiple, were found in the majority of eyes; most, however, were found in the anterior segment, and posterior segment injuries were proportionally less.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The prevalence of blindness caused by mine blast injuries is quite high. The resulting psychosocial trauma to the patients and their families is tremendous and has not been adequately highlighted. These injuries are a great drain on the country's resources. Enforcement of preventive measures and the use of protective gear and sophisticated equipment by the mine clearing personnel would prove to be far more economical in terms of human life as well as medical and economic resources.

To address this question, we have examined gene expression changes in M\u00fcller cells exposed to elevated pressure.<br/><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS: </b>Rat M\u00fcller cells (rMC-1) were exposed to elevated pressure, and RNA was extracted and analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays to identify pressure-responsive genes.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Analysis of microarray data showed that at 6\u2009h, 186 genes had > 1.5-fold change with FDR < 0.01. Of these, 62 genes were up-regulated while 124 genes were down-regulated. At 24\u2009h, 73 genes changed > 1.5-fold. Of these, 37 genes were up-regulated while 36 genes were down-regulated. Ingenuity canonical pathway analysis showed that several signaling and metabolic pathways were significantly changed in M\u00fcller cells under high pressure. In addition, among up- and down-regulated genes, we identified eight genes-areg, bmp4, cyp1b1, gpnmb, herc2, msh2, heph, and selenbp1, that have been directly or indirectly associated with elevated intraocular pressure. Two genes, areg and gpnmb, further showed time-dependent changes in mRNA and protein expression.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>The results show that M\u00fcller cells in vitro respond to elevated pressure by differential regulation of expressed genes. The transcriptional profile is different from that seen with hypoxia, which indicates that M\u00fcller cells respond differentially to different microenvironmental changes in the retina.<br/>", "score": 5, "id": "21780925", "title": "Gene expression changes in retinal M\u00fcller (glial) cells exposed to elevated pressure."}, {"abstract": "We studied a unique phenotype of cognitive delay, autistic behavior, and gait instability segregating in three separate sibships. We initiated genome-wide mapping in two sibships using Affymetrix 10K SNP Mapping Arrays and identified a homozygous 8.2 Mb region on chromosome 15 common to five affected children. We used exome sequencing of two affected children to assess coding sequence variants within the mapped interval. Four novel homozygous exome variants were shared between the two patients; however, only two variants localized to the mapped interval on chromosome 15. A third sibship in an Ohio Amish deme narrowed the mapped interval to 2.6 Mb and excluded one of the two novel homozygous exome variants. The remaining variant, a missense change in HERC2 (c.1781C>T, p.Pro594Leu), occurs in a highly conserved proline residue within an RCC1-like functional domain. Functional studies of truncated HERC2 in adherent retinal pigment epithelium cells suggest that the p.Pro594Leu variant induces protein aggregation and leads to decreased HERC2 abundance. The phenotypic correlation with the mouse Herc1 and Herc2 mutants as well as the phenotypic overlap with Angelman syndrome provide further evidence that pathogenic changes in HERC2 are associated with nonsyndromic intellectual disability, autism, and gait disturbance.

Many IPDs exhibit substantial phenotypic variability, but the basis is usually unknown. Mutations in MERTK cause recessive IPD phenotypes associated with the RP38 locus. We have identified a murine genetic modifier of Mertk-associated photoreceptor degeneration, the C57BL/6 (B6) allele of which acts as a suppressor. Photoreceptors degenerate rapidly in Mertk-deficient animals homozygous for the 129P2/Ola (129) modifier allele, whereas animals heterozygous for B6 and 129 modifier alleles exhibit an unusual intermixing of degenerating and preserved retinal regions, with females more severely affected than males. Mertk-deficient mice homozygous for the B6 modifier allele display degeneration only in the far periphery, even at 8 months of age, and have improved retinal function compared to animals homozygous for the 129 allele. We genetically mapped the modifier to an approximately 2-megabase critical interval that includes Tyro3, a paralog of Mertk. Tyro3 expression in the outer retina varies with modifier genotype in a manner characteristic of a cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), with the B6 allele conferring an approximately three-fold higher expression level. Loss of Tyro3 function accelerates the pace of photoreceptor degeneration in Mertk knockout mice, and TYRO3 protein is more abundant in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) adjacent to preserved central retinal regions of Mertk knockout mice homozygous for the B6 modifier allele. Endogenous human TYRO3 protein co-localizes with nascent photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagosomes in a primary RPE cell culture assay, and expression of murine Tyro3 in cultured cells stimulates phagocytic ingestion of POS.

Age-related morphological changes in the RPE have been associated with retinal degenerative disorders; our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remains incomplete.

Kl(-/-) mice show RPE and photoreceptor degeneration, reduced pigment synthesis in the RPE, and impaired phagocytosis of the outer segment of the photoreceptors. Klotho protein (KL) is expressed in primary cultured human RPE, and regulates pigment synthesis by increasing the expression of MITF (microphthalmia transcription factor) and TYR (tyrosinase), two pivotal genes in melanogenesis. Importantly, KL increases phagocytosis in cultured RPE by inducing gene expression of MERTK/AXL/TYRO3. These effects of KL are mediated through cAMP-PKA-dependent phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB. In cultured human RPE, KL increases the l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine synthesis and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion from basal membrane by inhibiting IGF-1 signaling and VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation. KL also regulates the expression of stress-related genes in RPE, lowers the production of reactive oxygen species, and thereby, protects RPE from oxidative stress. Together, our results demonstrate a critical function for KL in mouse retinal health in vivo, and a protective role toward human RPE cells in vitro.

Ligand-dependent activation of Mer in human monocytes led to Vav1 release and stimulated GDP replacement by GTP on RhoA family members. This unusual constitutive, SH2 domain-dependent, but phosphotyrosine-independent, interaction and its regulated local release and subsequent activation of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA may explain how Mer coordinates precise cytoskeletal changes governing the ingestion of apoptotic material by macrophages and pigmented retinal epithelial cells.", "score": 2, "id": "12920122", "title": "An SH2 domain-dependent, phosphotyrosine-independent interaction between Vav1 and the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase: a mechanism for localizing guanine nucleotide-exchange factor action."}, {"abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases, Tyro-3, Axl and Mer, collectively designated as TAM, are involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells.

integrin receptor alphavbeta5 controls two independent forms of interactions of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with adjacent photoreceptor outer segments that are essential for vision. Alphavbeta5 localizes specifically to apical microvilli of the RPE and contributes to retinal adhesion that maintains RPE contacts with intact outer segments at all times. Additionally, alphavbeta5 synchronizes diurnal bursts of RPE phagocytosis that clear photoreceptor outer segment fragments (POS) shed in a circadian rhythm. Dependence of retinal phagocytosis and adhesion on alphavbeta5 receptors suggests that the extracellular matrix ensheathing RPE microvilli contains ligands for this integrin. Here we studied mice lacking expression of functional MFG-E8 to test the contribution of this integrin ligand to alphavbeta5 functions in the retina. Lack of MFG-E8 only minimally reduced retinal adhesion. In contrast, lack of MFG-E8, like lack of alphavbeta5 receptor, eliminated alphavbeta5 downstream signaling involving the engulfment receptor MerTK and peak POS phagocytosis, both of which follow light onset in wild-type retina. MFG-E8-deficient RPE in primary culture retained normal epithelial morphology and levels of apical alphavbeta5 receptors, but showed impaired binding and engulfment of isolated POS. Soluble or POS-bound recombinant MFG-E8 was sufficient to fully restore phagocytosis by MFG-E8-deficient RPE. Furthermore, MFG-E8 supplementation strongly increased POS binding by wild-type and MerTK-deficient RPE, but did not affect POS binding by RPE lacking alphavbeta5. Thus, MFG-E8 stimulates rhythmic POS phagocytosis by ligating apical alphavbeta5 receptors of the RPE.

Molecular mechanisms that promote or synchronize POS tip shedding have thus far remained unknown. Here we examined plasma membrane asymmetry of living POS by quantifying surface exposure of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) using antibodies, annexin V, and pSIVA (polarity-sensitive indicator of viability and apoptosis), an annexin-based biosensor with switchable states of fluorescence. We found that isolated POS particles possess externalized PS, whose blockade or removal reduces their binding and engulfment by RPE in culture. Imaging of live photoreceptors in freshly dissected mouse retina detected PS externalization restricted to POS tips with discrete boundaries. In wild-type mice, frequency of rod tips exposing PS and length of tips with exposed PS peak shortly after light onset. In contrast, PS-marked POS tips do not vary in mice lacking the diurnal phagocytic rhythm of the RPE due to loss of either the phagocytosis receptor \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin, expressed by the RPE but not by photoreceptors, or its extracellular ligand milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8). These data identify a molecular distinction, localized PS exposure, that is specific to the surface of rod POS tips.

Hypotonia. Developmental delays. Often these findings are accompanied by episodic tachypnea or apnea and/or atypical eye movements. In general, the breathing abnormalities improve with age, truncal ataxia develops over time, and acquisition of gross motor milestones is delayed. Cognitive abilities are variable, ranging from severe intellectual disability to normal. The designation Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) is used to describe individuals with JS who have additional findings including retinal dystrophy, renal disease, ocular colobomas, occipital encephalocele, hepatic fibrosis, polydactyly, oral hamartomas, and endocrine abnormalities. Both intra- and interfamilial variation are seen.<br/><b>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: </b>The diagnosis of JSRD is based on the presence of characteristic clinical features and magnetic resonance images (MRI) through the junction of the midbrain and pons (isthmus region) that resemble a molar tooth. To date biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the following 19 genes are identified in about 50% of individuals with a JSRD: NPHP1, CEP290, AHI1, TMEM67 (MKS3), RPGRIP1L, CC2D2A, ARL13B, INPP5E, OFD1, TMEM216, KIF7, TCTN1, TCTN2, TMEM237, CEP41, TMEM138, C5orf42, TMEM231, and TCTN3; the other genes in which mutation is causative are unknown. To date, no individuals with JSRD and biallelic pathogenic variants in TTC21B have been reported.<br/><b>MANAGEMENT: </b>Treatment of manifestations: Infants and children with abnormal breathing may require stimulatory medications (e.g., caffeine); supplemental oxygen; mechanical support; or tracheostomy in rare cases. Other interventions may include speech therapy for oromotor dysfunction; occupational and physical therapy; educational support, including special programs for the visually impaired; and feedings by gastrostomy tube. Surgery may be required for polydactyly and symptomatic ptosis and/or strabismus. Nephronophthisis, end-stage renal disease, liver failure and/or fibrosis are treated with standard approaches. Surveillance: Annual evaluations of growth, vision, and liver and kidney function; periodic neuropsychologic and developmental testing. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in those with renal impairment; hepatotoxic drugs in those with liver impairment.<br/><b>GENETIC COUNSELING: </b>JSRDs are predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. JSRD caused by mutation of OFD1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. Digenic inheritance has been reported. For autosomal recessive inheritance: at conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

DNA samples were collected from 20 large consanguineous Indian families, in which arRP segregated and that were suitable for homozygosity mapping of the disease locus. After excluding linkage to all known arRP loci, a genome-wide scan was initiated. In two families, homozygosity mapping, haplotype analysis, and linkage data mapped the disease locus (RP22) in an approximately 16-cM region between D16S287 and D16S420 on the proximal short arm of chromosome 16.

Muscles from patients with FSHD showed large increases over controls in a single soluble, 34 kDa protein (pI=5.08) identified by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting as mu-crystallin (CRYM). Soluble fractions of biopsies of several other myopathies and muscular dystrophies showed no appreciable increases in mu-crystallin. Mu-crystallin has thyroid hormone and NADPH binding activity and so may influence differentiation and oxidative stress responses, reported to be altered in FSHD. It is also linked to retinal and inner ear defects, common in FSHD, suggesting that its up-regulation may play a specific and important role in pathogenesis of FSHD.", "score": 1, "id": "17451686",

A number of clinical studies have reported higher rates of ROP in infants who had perinatal infections or inflammation, suggesting that exposure of the developing retina to inflammation may disturb retinal vessel development. Thus, we investigated the effects of systemic inflammation on retinal vessel development and retinal inflammation in neonatal rats.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>To induce systemic inflammation, we intraperitoneally injected 100 \u03bcl lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.25 mg/ml) or the same volume of normal saline in rat pups on postnatal days 1, 3, and 5. The retinas were extracted on postnatal days 7 and 14, and subjected to assays for retinal vessels, inflammatory cells and molecules, and apoptosis.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>We found that intraperitoneal injection of LPS impaired retinal vessel development by decreasing vessel extension, reducing capillary density, and inducing localized overgrowth of abnormal retinal vessels and dilated peripheral vascular ridge, all of which are characteristic findings of ROP. Also, a large number of CD11c+ inflammatory cells and astrocytes were localized in the lesion of abnormal vessels. Further analysis revealed that the number of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIloCD68loCD11bloCD11chi cells in the retina was higher in LPS-treated rats compared to controls.

GFPhi dendritic cells played a significant role in clearing fluorescent-labeled retinal ganglion cells post-injury in the CD11c-DTR/GFP mice. In the TRIF and MyD88 deficient mice, the resting level of GFPhi dendritic cells was lower, and their influx was reduced following the optic nerve crush injury. The reduction in GFPhi dendritic cell numbers led to their replacement in the uptake of fluorescent-labeled debris by GFPlo microglia/macrophages. Depletion of GFPhi dendritic cells by treatment with diphtheria toxin also led to their displacement by GFPlo microglia/macrophages, which then assumed close contact with the injured neurons.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The contribution of recruited cells to the injury response was substantial, and regulated by MyD88 and TRIF. However, the presence of these adaptor proteins was not required for interaction with neurons, or the phagocytosis of debris.

Mononuclear phagocytes, such as macrophages and microglia cells, can produce VEGF. Their precursors, for example monocytes, can be recruited to sites of inflammation by the chemokine receptor CCR2, and this has been proposed to be important in AMD. To investigate the role of macrophages and CCR2 in AMD, we studied intracellular VEGF content in a laser-induced murine model of choroidal neovascularisation. To this end, we established a technique to quantify the VEGF content in cell subsets from the laser-treated retina and choroid separately. 3 days after laser, macrophage numbers and their VEGF content were substantially elevated in the choroid. Macrophage accumulation was CCR2-dependent, indicating recruitment from the circulation. In the retina, microglia cells were the main VEGF+ phagocyte type. A greater proportion of microglia cells contained VEGF after laser, and this was CCR2-independent. On day 6, VEGF-expressing macrophage numbers had already declined, whereas numbers of VEGF+ microglia cells remained increased. Other sources of VEGF detectable by flow cytometry included in dendritic cells and endothelial cells in both retina and choroid, and M\u00fcller cells/astrocytes in the retina. However, their VEGF content was not increased after laser. When we analyzed flatmounts of laser-treated eyes, CCR2-deficient mice showed reduced neovascular areas after 2 weeks, but this difference was not evident 3 weeks after laser. In summary, CCR2-dependent influx of macrophages causes a transient VEGF increase in the choroid. However, macrophages augmented choroidal neovascularization only initially, presumably because VEGF production by CCR2-independent eye cells prevailed at later time points. These findings identify macrophages as a relevant source of VEGF in laser-induced choroidal neovascularization but suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of CCR2-inhibition might be limited.", "score": 6, "id": "24714223", "title": "VEGF-production by CCR2-dependent macrophages contributes to laser-induced choroidal neovascularization."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>To investigate the characteristics of the mononuclear cell infiltrate in murine experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU).<br/><b>METHODS: </b>EAU was induced by immunization with bovine interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein (IRBP) in Freund's complete adjuvant (subcutaneous injection) and pertussis toxin (intraperitoneal injection) in B10RIII mouse.

Unlike several other pRb binding proteins, PP1alpha1 binds only weakly to the Rb family member p107, and does not demonstrate detectable binding to p130. Confirming the two-hybrid results, endogenous PP1 in a human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous pRb but not p107 or p130.

Emerin has proposed roles in nuclear architecture and gene regulation, but direct molecular links to disease were unknown. We report that Lim-domain only 7 (Lmo7) binds emerin directly with 125 nM affinity; the C-terminal half of human Lmo7 (hLmo7C) was sufficient to bind emerin in vitro. Lmo7 appeared relevant to EDMD because a deletion that removes Lmo7 (plus eight exons of a neighboring gene) in mice causes dystrophic muscles [Semenova, E., Wang, X., Jablonski, M.M., Levorse, J. and Tilghman, S.M.

Our data suggest endogenous Lmo7 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and might also localize at focal adhesions in HeLa cells. Two key results show that Lmo7 regulates emerin gene expression: rat Lmo7 isoforms directly activated a luciferase reporter gene in vivo, and emerin mRNA expression decreased 93% in Lmo7-downregulated HeLa cells. Thus, Lmo7 not only binds emerin protein but is also required for emerin gene transcription. Microarray analysis of Lmo7-downregulated HeLa cells identified over 4200 misregulated genes, including 46 genes important for muscle or heart. Misregulation of 11 genes, including four (CREBBP, NAP1L1, LAP2, RBL2) known to be misregulated in X-EDMD patients and emerin-null mice [Bakay, M., Wang, Z., Melcon, G., Schiltz, L., Xuan, J., Zhao, P., Sartorelli, V., Seo, J., Pegoraro, E., Angelini, C. et al.

Immunofluorescence analysis shows that angiomotin co-localized with ZO-1 in cell-cell contacts in endothelial cells in vitro and in angiogenic blood vessels of the postnatal mouse retina in vivo. Transfection of p80 as well as p130 angiomotin in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in junctional localization of both isoforms. Furthermore, p130 angiomotin could recruit ZO-1 to actin stress fibers. The p130 but not p80 isoform could be coprecipitated with MAGI-1b, a component of endothelial tight junctions.

AMPA receptors, with rapid recovery from desensitization, are proposed to transmit high temporal frequency signals, whereas kainate receptors (KARs) are presumed to encode lower temporal frequencies. Here we studied the glutamate receptors expressed by OFF-bipolar cells in slice preparations of macaque monkey retina, where the low (midget/parvocellular) and high-frequency (parasol/magnocellular) temporal channels are well characterized. We found that all OFF-bipolar types receive input primarily through KARs and that KAR antagonists block light-evoked input to both OFF-midget and OFF-parasol ganglion cells. KAR subunits were differentially expressed in OFF-bipolar types; the diffuse bipolar (DB) cells, DB2 and DB3b, expressed GluK1 and showed transient responses to glutamate and the KAR agonist, ATPA. In contrast, flat midget bipolar, DB1, and DB3a cells lacked GluK1 and showed relatively sustained responses. Finally, we found that the KAR accessory protein, Neto1, is expressed at the base of cone pedicles but is not colocalized with the GluK1 subunit.

Sixteen eyes of 13 patients had implantation of phakic intraocular lens for correction high myopia and developed serious complications have been included in this study. The mean age of patients was 38.6\u00b16.35y (range 32-50y) and the mean time of history of pIOL implantation for high myopia was 6\u00b12y (range 2-10y). Before corrective surgery, best spectacle-corrective visual acuity (BSCVA) ranged from perception to 20/200 in the eyes in which severe complications occurred.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Corneal decompensation occurred in 12 eyes of 9 high myopic patients after anterior chamber pIOL implantation. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurred in 4 eyes of 4 high myopic patients following anterior chamber and posterior chamber pIOL implantation. Patients with corneal decompensation, had combined procedures consisting of pIOL removal and penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). Removals of pIOL, phacoemulsification and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with silicone oil tamponade were performed in patients with RRD. After corrective surgeries, all patients but one (P+, patient 2, right eye) achieved moderate BSCVA ranged from 20/200 to 20/50 at the last visit.<br/><b>CONCLUSION: </b>Phakic IOLs may be effective for the correction of high myopia. Although these IOLs may have severe complications and it affects safety and efficacy of this surgery. As seen here, corneal decompensation and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are possible postoperative vision-threatening complications of phakic IOLs.

S1P is a biologically active lysophospholipid with multiple roles in signalling. The mechanism of action of Spns2 is still elusive in mammals. Here, we report that Spns2-deficient mice rapidly lost auditory sensitivity and endocochlear potential (EP) from 2 to 3 weeks old. We found progressive degeneration of sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti, but the earliest defect was a decline in the EP, suggesting that dysfunction of the lateral wall was the primary lesion. In the lateral wall of adult mutants, we observed structural changes of marginal cell boundaries and of strial capillaries, and reduced expression of several key proteins involved in the generation of the EP (Kcnj10, Kcnq1, Gjb2 and Gjb6), but these changes were likely to be secondary. Permeability of the boundaries of the stria vascularis and of the strial capillaries appeared normal. We also found focal retinal degeneration and anomalies of retinal capillaries together with anterior eye defects in Spns2 mutant mice. Targeted inactivation of Spns2 in red blood cells, platelets, or lymphatic or vascular endothelial cells did not affect hearing, but targeted ablation of Spns2 in the cochlea using a Sox10-Cre allele produced a similar auditory phenotype to the original mutation, suggesting that local Spns2 expression is critical for hearing in mammals.

Here, we demonstrate multiple genome modifications mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Multiple genes including golden/gol and tyrosinase/tyr, which are involved in pigment formation, and s1pr2 and spns2, which are involved in cardiac development, were disrupted with insertion and/or deletion (indel) mutations introduced by the co-injection of multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) and the nuclease Cas9 mRNA. We simultaneously observed two distinct phenotypes, such as, the two hearts phenotype and the hypopigmentation of skin melanophores and the retinal pigment epithelium, in the injected F0 embryos. Additionally, we detected the targeted deletion and inversion genes as a 7.1-kb fragment between the two distinct spns2 targeted sites together with indel mutations. Conversely, chromosomal translocations among five target loci were not detected.

Angle closure glaucoma, a common cause of glaucoma in Asia that affects tens of millions of people worldwide, often presents acutely with loss of vision, pain, and high IOP. Even when medical and surgical treatment is available, acute angle closure glaucoma can cause permanent and irreversible loss of vision. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of IOP-induced RGC death, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In the present study, we used an acute IOP elevation/glaucoma model to investigate the underlying mechanism of RGC death. We found that TLR4 leads to increased caspase-8 expression; this elevation increases IL-1\u03b2 expression and RGC death via a caspase-1-dependent pathway involving Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1)/NLRP3 inflammasomes and a caspase-1-independent pathway. We show that inhibition of caspase-8 activation significantly attenuates RGC death by down-regulating the activation of NLRP1 and NLRP3, thus demonstrating the pivotal role of caspase-8 in the TLR4-mediated activation of inflammasomes. These findings demonstrate collectively a critical role of caspase-8 in transducing TLR4-mediated IL-1\u03b2 production and RGC death and highlight signal transduction in a caspase-1-dependent NLRP1/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and a caspase-1-independent pathway in acute glaucoma.

Pathogen-stimulated NLRs such as NLR family Pyrin domain-containing protein 1 (NLRP1) assemble into molecular platforms called \"inflammasomes\" to activate inflammatory protease caspase-1, which processes pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into active cytokines.

organ and a self-sustained circadian clock. Gene targeting studies have revealed that mammalian circadian clocks generate molecular circadian rhythms through coupled transcription/translation feedback loops which involve 6 core clock genes, namely Period (Per) 1 and 2, Cryptochrome (Cry) 1 and 2, Clock, and Bmal1 and that the roles of individual clock genes in rhythms generation are tissue-specific. However, the mechanisms of molecular circadian rhythms in the mammalian retina are incompletely understood and the extent to which retinal neural clocks share mechanisms with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central neural clock, is unclear. In the present study, we examined the rhythmic amplitude and period of real-time bioluminescence rhythms in explants of retina from Per1-, Per2-, Per3-, Cry1-, Cry2-, and Clock-deficient mice that carried transgenic PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) or Period1::luciferase (Per1::luc) circadian reporters. Per1-, Cry1- and Clock-deficient retinal and SCN explants showed weakened or disrupted rhythms, with stronger effects in retina compared to SCN. Per2, Per3, and Cry2 were individually dispensable for sustained rhythms in both tissues. Retinal and SCN explants from double knockouts of Cry1 and Cry2 were arrhythmic. Gene effects on period were divergent with reduction in the number of Per1 alleles shortening circadian period in retina, but lengthening it in SCN, and knockout of Per3 substantially shortening retinal clock period, but leaving SCN unaffected. Thus, the retinal neural clock has a unique pattern of clock gene dependence at the tissue level that it is similar in pattern, but more severe in degree, than the SCN neural clock, with divergent clock gene regulation of rhythmic period.", "score": 11, "id": "22701739", "title": "Divergent roles of clock genes in retinal and suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian oscillators."}, {"abstract": "Mammalian retina contains a circadian clock that is composed of components similar to those of the master circadian clock within the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus.

In mice lacking melanopsin, we found an unexpected loss of clock gene rhythms and of the photic induction of Per1-Per2 mRNAs only in the outer retina. Since melanopsin ganglion cells are known to provide a feed-back signalling pathway for photic information to dopaminergic cells, we further examined dopamine (DA) synthesis in Opn 4 (-/-) mice.

The abnormalities in the mutant mice were intensity-dependent in phase delay and duration-dependent in phase advance. The knockout mice also displayed blunted masking, which was dependent on lighting conditions, but not completely lost. The dysfunctions of masking in the mutant mice were recovered by infusion of PACAP-38. By contrast, these mutant mice show a normal PLR. We examined the retinal morphology and innervations in the mutant mice, and no apparent changes were observed in melanopsin-immunoreactive cells. These data suggest that the dysfunctions of entrainment and masking were caused by the loss of PACAP, not by the loss of light input itself. Moreover, PACAP-deficient mice express an unusually early onset of activities, from approximately four hours before the dark period, without influencing the phase of the endogenous circadian clock.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: </b>Although some groups including us reported the abnormalities in photic entrainments in PACAP- and PAC(1)-knockout mice, there were inconsistencies in their results.

When compared with wild-type controls, these mice exhibit larger phase advances to a short late-night light pulse and larger delays to long 12 h light pulses that span the whole subjective night. Fos and mPer1 expression in the retinorecipient SCN is significantly attenuated following late-night light pulses in the 5-HT(1A) knockout animals. Finally, non-photic phase shifts to (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) are lost in the knockout animals, while attenuation of the phase shift to the long light pulse due to rebound activity following a wheel lock is unaffected. These findings suggest that the 5-HT(1A) receptor plays an inhibitory role in behavioral phase shifts, a facilitatory role in light-induced gene expression, a necessary role in phase shifts to 8-OH-DPAT, and is not necessary for activity-induced phase advances that oppose photic phase shifts to long light pulses.", "score": 1, "id": "18930788", "title": "Altered photic and non-photic phase shifts in 5-HT(1A) receptor knockout mice."}, {"abstract": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal circadian pacemaker in mammals. A salient feature of the SCN is that cells of a particular phenotype are topographically organized; this organization defines functionally distinct subregions that interact to generate coherent rhythmicity. In Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), a dense population of directly retinorecipient calbindin D(28K) (CalB) neurons in the caudal SCN marks a subregion critical for circadian rhythmicity. In mouse SCN, a dense cluster of CalB neurons occurs during early postnatal development, but in the adult CalB neurons are dispersed through the SCN. In the adult retina CalB colocalizes with melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells. In the present study, we explored the role of CalB in modulating circadian function and photic entrainment by investigating mice with a targeted mutation of the CalB gene (CalB-/- mice). In constant darkness (DD), CalB-/- animals either become arrhythmic (40%) or exhibit low-amplitude locomotor rhythms with marked activity during subjective day (60%). Rhythmic clock gene expression is blunted in these latter animals. Importantly, CalB-/- mice exhibit anomalies in entrainment revealed following transfer from a light : dark cycle to DD. Paradoxically, responses to acute light pulses measured by behavioral phase shifts, SCN FOS protein and Period1 mRNA expression are normal. Together, the developmental pattern of CalB expression in mouse SCN, the presence of CalB in photoresponsive ganglion cells and the abnormalities seen in CalB-/- mice suggest an important role for CalB in mouse circadian function.", "score": 1, "id": "18588531", "title": "Targeted mutation of the calbindin D28K gene disrupts circadian rhythmicity and entrainment."}, {"abstract": "In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the circadian pacemaker, receives light information via the retina and functions in the entrainment of circadian rhythms and in phasing the seasonal responses of behavioral and physiological functions.

Under long photoperiod (LP) conditions, the expression rhythms of mPer1 and Bmal1 in the caudal SCN phase-led those in the rostral SCN; further, within the middle SCN, the rhythms in the ventrolateral (VL)-like subdivision advanced compared with those in the dorsomedial (DM)-like subdivision. The mPer1::luc rhythms in the entire coronal slice obtained from the middle SCN exhibited 2 peaks with a wide peak width under LP conditions. Imaging analysis of the mPer1::luc rhythms in several subdivisions of the rostral, middle, caudal, and horizontal SCN revealed wide regional variations in the peak time in the rostral half of the SCN under LP conditions.

The process of synchronization to the environment involves the transcriptional activation of several genes. Photic input signals from the retina are transduced via the retinohypothalamic tract to the central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. It is known that cells of peripheral organs possess similar molecular organizations, but the signal transductional pathways lack direct light entrainment. It has been assumed that the adaptation of peripheral organs to the SCN phase is achieved by the alternate usage of promoter elements. This question has been addressed by characterizing the signal transductional pathways regulating human Period-1 gene expression in human hepatoma cells (HuH-7). Plasmids coding for key modulators of circadian rhythm, hCLOCK, hBMAL1, and hCRY2 were used to analyze the activation of a human period-1 promoter luciferase (hPER1-luc) construct. Beside classical CLOCK/BMAL1 activation, hPER1-luc was also inducible by the overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Calpha). The cotransfection of dominant negative constructs to c-FOS, CREB, PKA, and C/EBP were used to characterize both regulatory pathways. It was found that hCLOCK/hBMAL1-mediated hPER1 activation was influenced by AP1, but not significantly by other regulators. Conversely, PKA-induced activation of hPER1 was reduced by the inhibition of CREB and the CCAAT-box binding protein C/EBP, but not by AP1.

Here we used a combination of biochemical, immunohistochemical and behavioral techniques to examine both the regulation and role of PKC in light-induced clock entrainment in mice. We report that photic stimulation during the subjective night, but not during the subjective day, stimulates PKC activity within the SCN. To assess the role of PKC in clock entrainment, we employed an in-vivo infusion approach to deliver the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I to the SCN. The disruption of PKC activity significantly enhanced the phase-shifting effects of light, indicating that PKC functions as a negative regulator of light entrainment. Importantly, bisindolylmaleimide I infusion in the absence of light treatment did not phase shift the clock, demonstrating that transient disruption of basal PKC activity does not affect inherent pacemaker activity. The capacity of light to stimulate immediate early gene expression in the SCN was not substantively altered by PKC inhibition, suggesting that PKC does not couple light to rapid transcriptional activation. Rather, a combination of in-vivo and cell culture assays indicates that PKC functions as an inhibitor of PERIOD1 degradation.

Recordings of running-wheel activity in constant darkness (DD) revealed that the intrinsic periods of T20 mice were significantly shorter than of T28 mice at all ages. Aftereffects following the shorter light cycle were significantly smaller in mice older than 3 months, corresponding with a decreased ability to entrain to T20. Age did not diminish entrainment or aftereffects in the 28-h light schedule. The behavioral period of pups born in DD depended on the T cycle experienced in utero, showing maternal transference of aftereffects. Recordings of Per1-luc activity from the isolated SCN in vitro revealed that the SCN of young mice expressed aftereffects, but the periods of behavior and SCN were negatively correlated.

study was to quantify gene expression levels of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A and C subfamilies ABCA1-A9, and ABCC1-6/Mrp1-6, C10/Mrp7 in mouse retinal vascular endothelial cells (RVEC) using a combination of a magnetic isolation method for mouse RVEC and real-time quantitative PCR analysis. The transcript level of endothelial cell markers, such as CD31, Tie-2, claudin-5, occludin, ABCB1a/mdr1a, and ABCG2, were more than 20-fold higher than those in the non-RVEC fraction, suggesting that RVEC in the RVEC fraction are concentrated at least 20-fold compared with those of the non-RVEC fraction. In the ABCA1 to A9 families, the transcript level of ABCA3 and A9 in the RVEC fraction was 1.2- and 32-fold higher than that in the non-RVEC fraction. Although ABCA3 was expressed in both the RVEC and non-RVEC fractions, A9 is predominantly expressed in the RVEC fraction. In the ABCC1 to C6 and C10 families, the transcript level of ABCC3, C4, and C6 in the RVEC fraction was 27-, 251-, and 242-fold higher, respectively, than that in the non-RVEC fraction, suggesting that ABCC3, C4, and C6 are predominantly expressed in the RVEC. In conclusion, ABCA3, ABCA9, ABCC3, ABCC4, and ABCC6 mRNAs are predominantly expressed at the inner blood-retina barrier (inner BRB) and appear to play a major role in the efflux transport of their substrates at the inner BRB.", "score": 3, "id": "17574281", "title": "Gene expression profiles of ATP-binding cassette transporter A and C subfamilies in mouse retinal vascular endothelial cells."}, {"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>The current study aims to quantifies the level of expression of selected adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters and the major drug metabolizing enzyme CYP450 3A12 in the eyes of dogs.<br/><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS: </b>The levels of expression were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the cornea, conjunctiva and retinal tissue.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>ABCB1 mRNA is present at high levels in all analysed tissues.

MRP1-5 can collectively confer resistance to natural product anticancer drugs and their conjugated metabolites, platinum compounds, folate antimetabolites, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, and alkylating agents. MRP1-3 are often associated with tumor resistance which is often caused by an increased efflux and decreased intracellular accumulation of natural product anticancer drugs and other anticancer agents. Both PGE(1) and PGE(2) are known high-affinity substrates of MRP4, but not MRP1, MRP2, MRP3 and MRP5. LTC(4) is a substrate of MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP6-8. MRP2 is also able to transport LTD(4) and LTE(4). Experimental studies in Abcc1-difficient mice have demonstrated a role of MRP1 in inflammation process in vivo. Abcc3-difficient mice have normal bile salt transport, however they have decreased blood bilirubin glucuronide levels. Abcc6-difficient mice show remarkable mineraliztion of the connective tissues, including skin, arterial blood vessels, and retina. Most MRP/ABCC transporters are subject to inhibition by a variety of compounds. Drug targeting of these transporters to overcome MRP/ABCC-mediated multidrug resistance may play a role in cancer and infection (e.g. HIV infection) chemotherapy. Some modulators of MRPs have shown reversing effects on MDR phenotype in preliminary clinical studies and some modulators of MRPs may modify the inflammatory process and consequently ameliorate the inflammatory symptoms. A better understanding of the interactions of these modulators with MRPs has important implications in development of novel drugs for treatment of cancer, infection and inflammation.", "score": 1,

Acute hyperglycemia induced by dextrose ingestion does not restore their retinal function, which is consistent with irreversible loss of vision. The goal of this study was to establish whether long-term administration of high dietary glucose rescues retinal function and circuit connectivity in aged Gcgr-/- mice.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Gcgr-/- mice were administered a carbohydrate-rich diet starting at 12 months of age. After 1 month of treatment, retinal function and structure were evaluated using electroretinographic (ERG) recordings and immunohistochemistry.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Treatment with a carbohydrate-rich diet raised blood glucose levels and improved retinal function in Gcgr-/- mice. Blood glucose increased from moderate hypoglycemia to euglycemic levels, whereas ERG b-wave sensitivity improved approximately 10-fold. Because the b-wave reflects the electrical activity of second-order cells, we examined for changes in rod-to-bipolar cell synapses. Gcgr-/- retinas have 20% fewer synaptic pairings than Gcgr+/- retinas. Remarkably, most of the lost synapses were located farthest from the bipolar cell body, near the distal boundary of the outer plexiform layer (OPL), suggesting that apical synapses are most vulnerable to chronic hypoglycemia. Although treatment with the carbohydrate-rich diet restored retinal function, it did not restore these synaptic contacts.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Prolonged exposure to diet-induced euglycemia improves retinal function but does not reestablish synaptic contacts lost by chronic hypoglycemia. These results suggest that retinal neurons have a homeostatic mechanism that integrates energetic status over prolonged periods of time and allows them to recover functionality despite synaptic loss.<br/>", "score": 10, "id": "22232430", "title": "Partial rescue of retinal function in chronically hypoglycemic mice."}, {"abstract": "The retina is among the most metabolically active tissues in the body, requiring a constant supply of blood glucose to sustain function.

Metabolic stress from moderate hypoglycemia led to late-onset loss of retinal function in Gcgr(-/-) mice, loss of visual acuity, and eventual death of retinal cells. Retinal function measured by the electroretinogram b-wave threshold declined >100-fold from age 9 to 13 months, whereas decreases in photoreceptor function measured by the ERG a-wave were delayed by 3 months. At 10 months of age Gcgr(-/-) mice began to lose visual acuity and exhibit changes in retinal anatomy, including an increase in cell death that was initially more pronounced in the inner retina.

Activation of SREBP by Akt depends on the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) but the exact mechanism of this activation remains unclear. We have investigated whether ablation of different signalling molecules downstream of mTORC1 affects expression of SREBP targets genes.

Furthermore, accumulation of mature SREBP1 was not inhibited after combined silencing of S6-kinases 1 and 2.

The cognate bovine alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase shares 67.3, 69.0, and 69.3% amino acid sequence identities with human FUC-T3, FUC-T5, and FUC-T6 enzymes, respectively. As revealed by protein sequence alignment, potential sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation and conserved cysteines, the bovine enzyme is an intermediate between FUC-T3, FUC-T5, and FUC-T6 human enzymes. Transfected into COS-7 cells, the bovine gene induced the synthesis of an alpha(1, 3)-fucosyltransferase enzyme with type 2 substrate acceptor pattern specificity and induced expression of fucosylated type 2 epitopes (Lex and sialyl-Lex), but not of type 1 structures (Lea or sialyl-Lea), suggesting that it has an acceptor specificity similar to the human plasma FUC-T6. However, no enzyme activity was detected in bovine plasma. Gene transcripts are detected on tissues such as bovine liver, kidney, lung, and brain. The type 2 sialyl-Lex epitope was found in renal macula densa and biliary ducts, and Lex and Ley epitopes were detected on the brush border of epithelial cells of small and large intestine, suggesting a tissue distribution closer to human FUC-T3, but fucosylated type 1 structures (Lea, Leb, or sialyl-Lea) were not detected at all in any bovine tissue. Analysis of genetic distances on a combined phylogenetic tree of fucosyltransferase genes suggests that the bovine gene is the orthologous homologue of the ancestor of human genes constituting the present FUT3-FUT5-FUT6 cluster.", "score": 1, "id": "9079712", "title": "Molecular cloning and expression of a bovine alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase gene homologous to a putative ancestor gene of the

"<b>PURPOSE: </b>Members of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) family of cytokines have been shown to influence neuronal differentiation during retinal development and enhance cell survival in various retinal degeneration models. However, the cellular mechanism of CNTF signaling and the target cell types for CNTF in the developing retina remain unidentified. The purpose of this study is to characterize expression patterns of proteins involved in cytokine signal transduction in the mouse retina, thus to assess the potential responsiveness of different retinal cell types to CNTF-like cytokine signals.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>The expression profiles of various cytokine signal transduction components, including receptor subunits CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFRa) and gp130, intracellular protein kinases, Jak2 and Tyk2, as well as latent transcription factors, STAT1 and STAT3, were determined by immunohistochemical staining of mouse retinal sections derived from different postnatal stages. In addition, the distribution of ERK was studied by immunofluorescent staining.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>In the neonatal retina, intense staining signals for gp130, CNTFRalpha, Jak2, Tyk2, STAT1, and STAT3 were present in the differentiated ganglion cell layer and the developing inner plexiform layer of the mouse retina. Detectable staining signals were also observed in the ventricular zone of the early postnatal mouse retina. From P5 to P10, cytokine signaling molecules also accumulated in the developing outer plexiform layer. In the adult retina, cytokine signaling components examined were localized to the ganglion cell layer, the inner nuclear layer, and the two plexiform layers. In addition, regions corresponding to the inner and/or outer segments of the photoreceptor cells showed positive staining for cytokine signaling components. In contrast, the ERK2 protein kinase was found throughout the neonatal retina. In the mature retina, ERK2 was concentrated in the ganglion cells and the inner plexiform layer, while a lesser expression of ERK2 was detected in the inner nuclear layer, the outer plexiform layers, and the outer nuclear layer.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>In the neonatal mouse retina, signaling components of the Jak-STAT pathway and ERK2 are differentially expressed. All cytokine signaling components included in this study are expressed in the differentiated inner retina as well as in cells occupying the ventricular zone, suggesting that both postmitotic neurons and proliferative progenitors may directly respond to CNTF-like cytokines during postnatal development. The distribution of cytokine signaling pathway components in the adult mouse retina is consistent with previous findings that ganglion cells and M\u00fcller glia are the primary target cell types for CNTF.<br/>", "score": 16, "id": "14685141", "title": "Expression of cytokine signal transduction components in the postnatal mouse retina."}, {"abstract": "Janus kinase and microtubule interacting protein 1, (Jakmip1) conserved in vertebrates and predominantly expressed in neural tissues, was identified for its ability to bind Tyk2, a member of the Janus kinase (Jak) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently Jakmip1 was also identified as an interacting partner of GABA(B)R1 and as a regulatory protein of GABA(B)R2 mRNA. We have confirmed that this gene is highly expressed in brain and retina tissues and it is also present at lower levels in other tissues. We have identified four new transcripts of 2975 bp, 1743 bp, 2189 bp and 2420 bp respectively, named Jakmip1B, Jakmip1C, Jakmip1D and Jakmip1E. The involvement of the Janus kinase pathway in the development of mouse retina and in the control of survival and proliferation of human retinal ganglion cells, together with the restricted Jakmip1 gene expression pattern, may suggest this gene is a putative candidate for neuro-degenerative and retinal diseases. For this reason, a mutation analysis of the Jakmip1 gene in a panel of 50 unrelated patients with retinitis pigmentosa has been performed, revealing no pathogenic mutations.", "score": 5, "id": "17761393", "title": "Identification and expression analysis of novel Jakmip1 transcripts."}, {"abstract": "We examined the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on intracellular signal transduction pathways using isolated bovine microvascular endothelial cells (BREC). When cell growth was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation, it was significantly stimulated by VEGF stimulation. In situ hybridization results also demonstrated that c-fos expression was enhanced by the stimulation. Although BREC expressed Flt-1 and Flk-1 as VEGF receptors at similar levels, VEGF stimulation preferentially enhanced the activity of Flt-1 tyrosine kinase. This stimulation initiated an increase in the level of GTP-form Ras and the activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). On the other hand, BREC expressed the Janus kinase (Jak) family members Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, and the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) family members Stat1, Stat3, and Stat6. These molecules were tyrosine phosphorylated under culture conditions used, and the phosphorylation of Tyk2 and Stat6 was specifically enhanced by VEGF stimulation. These results demonstrate that, in addition to Ras/MAPK pathways, the Flt-1/Tyk2/Stat6 pathway is important in VEGF signaling in BREC.

accumulation (NBIA) is a group of inherited neurologic disorders in which iron accumulates in the basal ganglia resulting in progressive dystonia, spasticity, parkinsonism, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and optic atrophy or retinal degeneration. Ten types and their associated genes are recognized. The age of onset ranges from infancy to late adulthood; the rate of progression varies. Cognitive decline occurs in some subtypes, but more often cognition is relatively spared. Cerebellar atrophy is a frequent finding in some subtypes.<br/><b>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: </b>The diagnosis is usually first suspected when brain MRI findings suggest abnormal brain iron accumulation. Clinical findings and molecular genetic testing establish the diagnosis of specific types. The ten genes known to be associated with types of NBIA are PANK2, PLA2G6, C19orf12, FA2H, ATP13A2, WDR45, COASY, FTL, CP, and DCAF17.<br/><b>GENETIC COUNSELING: </b>Eight of the ten genetically defined types of NBIA are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Exceptions are: beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), caused by de novo mutations in WDR45, which is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner with suspected male lethality; and neuroferritinopathy, caused by mutations in FTL, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. If the family-specific mutations are known, carrier testing for family members at risk for the autosomal recessive types and the X-linked type is possible, and prenatal testing for most types is possible.<br/><b>MANAGEMENT: </b>Treatment of manifestations: Intrathecal or oral baclofen, oral trihexyphenidyl, intramuscular botulinum toxin, and deep brain stimulation to treat dystonia; services for the blind, educational programs, assistive communication devices; adaptive aids (walkers, wheelchairs) for gait abnormalities. Prevention of secondary complications: Adequate nutrition through swallowing evaluation, dietary assessment, gastrostomy tube feeding as needed. Surveillance: Evaluation for treatable causes of pain during episodes of extreme dystonia; monitoring of height and weight; routine ophthalmologic assessment; regular assessments of ambulation and speech abilities.<br/>", "score": 1, "id": "23447832", "title": "Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation Disorders Overview"}, {"abstract": "Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a hereditary progressive disorder and the most frequent form of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). PKAN patients present with a progressive movement disorder, dysarthria, cognitive impairment and retinitis pigmentosa. In magnetic resonance imaging, PKAN patients exhibit the pathognonomic \"eye of the tiger\" sign in the globus pallidus which corresponds to iron accumulation and gliosis as shown in neuropathological examinations. The discovery of the disease causing mutations in PANK2 has linked the disorder to coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism. PANK2 is the only one out of four PANK genes encoding an isoform which localizes to mitochondria. At least two other NBIA genes (PLA2G6, C19orf12) encode proteins that share with PANK2 a mitochondrial localization and all are suggested to play a role in lipid homeostasis. With no causal therapy available for PKAN until now, only symptomatic treatment is possible. A multi-centre retrospective study with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation in patients with NBIA revealed a significant improvement of dystonia. Recently, studies in the PANK Drosophila model \"fumble\" revealed improvement by the compound pantethine which is hypothesized to feed an alternate CoA biosynthesis pathway. In addition, pilot studies with the iron chelator deferiprone that crosses the blood brain barrier showed a good safety profile and some indication of efficacy. An adequately powered randomized clinical trial will start in 2012. This review summarizes clinical presentation, neuropathology and pathogenesis of PKAN.", "score": 1, "id": "22515741", "title": "Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration."}]},

"Members of the ProSAP/Shank family are important scaffolding proteins of the postsynaptic density (PSD). We investigated for the first time the expression of the three family members named Shank1, ProSAP1/Shank2, and ProSAP2/Shank3 during Xenopus laevis development. Shank1 is expressed in the neural tube, the retina, and the cranial ganglions. In contrast, ProSAP1/Shank2 transcripts could be visualized in the otic vesicle, the pronephros, the liver, the neural tube, and the retina. ProSAP2/Shank3 could be detected in the cardiovascular network, the neural tube, the pronephros, and the retina. Furthermore, we showed that LAPSER1 interacts with all three ProSAP/Shank family members in Xenopus embryos and co-localizes with ProSAP/Shank in a cell-based assay. In Xenopus, LAPSER1 is expressed in somites, brain, proctodeum, pronephros, and in some cranial ganglions. Thus, we suggest that members of the ProSAP/Shank family and LAPSER1 not only play a role in PSD formation and plasticity, but also during embryonic development.", "score": 3, "id": "21445960",

Additionally, the homozygous male mutants are infertile due to azoospermia, a condition that was not appreciated in the human. Arrest occurs in spermiogenesis, with complete absence of elongated and mature spermatids. In contrast to the human, however, no changes were observed in the basal ganglia by MRI or by histological exam, nor were there signs of dystonia, even after following the mice for one year.

PKAN is characterized by dystonia, dysarthria, rigidity and pigmentary retinal degeneration. The pathogenesis of this disorder is poorly understood and, although PANK2 is a mitochondrial protein, perturbations in mitochondrial bioenergetics have not been reported. A knock-out (KO) mouse model of PKAN exhibits retinal degeneration and azoospermia, but lacks any neurological phenotype. The absence of a clinical phenotype has partially been explained by the different cellular localization of the human and murine PANK2 proteins. Here we demonstrate that the mouse Pank2 protein localizes to mitochondria, similar to its human orthologue.

Further attention has been focused on this pathway by the recent discovery that mutations in the gene encoding CoA synthase lead to a similar neurodegenerative disorder, raising the spectre of a common mechanism of pathogenesis. How do defects in CoA production result in neurodegeneration? Why are certain tissues and cell types selectively vulnerable? And what is the underlying neurodegenerative process? Answers to some of these questions have come from animal models of disease, including flies and mice, as well as directly from humans. The damaged tissue types share key features that are likely to contribute to their selective vulnerability. These include the presence of a blood-tissue barrier, the milieu with respect to oxidative stress, tissue metabolic demand, relative expression of genes encoding similar proteins in these tissues and cell membrane composition.

Organisms are equipped with specific proteins designed for iron acquisition, export and transport, and storage, as well as with sophisticated mechanisms that maintain the intracellular labile iron pool at an appropriate level. Despite these homeostatic mechanisms, organisms often face the threat of either iron deficiency or iron overload. This review describes several hereditary iron-overloading conditions that are confined to the brain. Recently, a mutation in the L-subunit of ferritin has been described that causes the formation of aberrant L-ferritin with an altered C-terminus. Individuals with this mutation in one allele of L-ferritin have abnormal aggregates of ferritin and iron in the brain, primarily in the globus pallidus. Patients with this dominantly inherited late-onset disease present with symptoms of extrapyramidal dysfunction. Mice with a targeted disruption of a gene for iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), a translational repressor of ferritin, misregulate iron metabolism in the intestinal mucosa and the central nervous system. Significant amounts of ferritin and iron accumulate in white matter tracts and nuclei, and adult IRP2-deficient mice develop a movement disorder consisting of ataxia, bradykinesia, and tremor. Mutations in the frataxin gene are responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, the most common of the inherited ataxias. Frataxin appears to regulate mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster formation, and the neurologic and cardiac manifestations of Friedreich's ataxia are due to iron-mediated mitochondrial toxicity. Patients with Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, an autosomal recessive, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, have mutations in a novel pantothenate kinase gene (PANK2). The cardinal feature of this extrapyramidal disease is pathologic iron accumulation in the globus pallidus. The defect in PANK2 is predicted to cause the accumulation of cysteine, which binds iron and causes oxidative stress in the iron-rich globus pallidus. Finally, aceruloplasminemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism caused by loss-of-function mutations in ceruloplasmin gene that leads to misregulation of both systemic and central nervous system iron trafficking. Affected individuals suffer from extrapyramidal signs, cerebellar ataxia, progressive neurodegeneration of retina, and diabetes mellitus.

Despite recent advances in the genetics of Alagille syndrome, the correlations between genotypes and phenotypes remain incompletely defined.", "score": 1, "id": "18097983", "title": "The genetics and ocular findings of Alagille syndrome."}, {"abstract": "Canonical WNT signals are transduced through Frizzled (FZD) family receptor and LRP5/LRP6 co-receptor to upregulate MYC, CCND1, FGF20, JAG1, WISP1 and DKK1 genes, while non-canonical WNT signals are transduced through FZD family receptor and PTK7/ROR2/RYK co-receptor to activate RHOA/RHOU/RAC/CDC42, JNK, PKC, NFAT and NLK signaling cascades. FZD7, expressed in the normal gastrointestinal tract, is upregulated in esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 genes were identified and characterized by using bioinformatics (Techint) and human intelligence (Humint). Chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 genes were identified within NW_001232110.1 and AC173037.2 genome sequences, respectively. Chimpanzee FZD7 and cow Fzd7 showed 100% and 97.2% total-amino-acid identity with human FZD7. All of the nine amino-acid residues substituted between human FZD7 and human FzE3 were identical to those of human FZD7 in chimpanzee, cow, mouse and rat FZD7 orthologs. Functional analyses using FzE3 with multiple cloning artifacts and/or sequencing errors are invalid. FZD7 orthologs were seven-transmembrane proteins with extracellular Frizzled domain, leucine zipper motif around the 5th transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic DVL- and PDZ-binding motifs. Ser550 and Ser556 of FZD7 orthologs were putative aPKC phosphorylation sites. Dimerization and Ser550/556 phosphorylation were predicted as regulatory mechanisms for the signaling through FZD7. Transcriptional start site of human FZD7 gene was 735-bp upstream of NM_003507.1 RefSeq 5'-end. In addition to gastrointestinal cancer, hepatocellular cancer and pancreatic cancer, human FZD7 mRNAs were expressed in blastocysts, undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells, ES-derived endodermal progenitors, ES-derived neural progenitors, fetal cochlea, retinal pigment epithelium, olfactory epithelium, regenerating liver, and multiple sclerosis. Comparative genomics analyses revealed that the binding sites for PU.1, SP1/Kr\u00fcppel-like, CCAAT-box, and TCF/LEF/SOX transcription factors were conserved among 5'-promoter regions of mammalian FZD7 orthologs.", "score": 1, "id": "17273804", "title": "Comparative integromics on FZD7 orthologs: conserved binding sites for PU.1, SP1, CCAAT-box and TCF/LEF/SOX transcription factors within 5'-promoter region of mammalian FZD7 orthologs."}, {"abstract": "The critical contribution of the Notch signaling pathway to vascular morphogenesis has been underscored by loss-of-function studies in mouse and zebrafish. Nonetheless, a comprehensive understanding as to how this signaling system influences the formation of blood vessels at the cellular and molecular level is far from reached. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the distribution of active Notch1 in relation to its DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag2) ligands, Jagged1, Delta-like1, and Delta-like4, during progressive stages of vascular morphogenesis and maturation. Important differences in the cellular distribution of Notch ligands were found. Jagged1 (Jag1) was detected in \"stalk cells\" of the leading vasculature and at arterial branch points, a site where Delta-like4 (Dll4) was clearly absent. Dll4 was the only ligand expressed in \"tip cells\" at the end of the growing vascular sprouts. It was also present in stalk cells, capillaries, arterial endothelium, and in mural cells of mature arteries in a homogenous manner. Delta-like1 (Dll1) was observed in both arteries and veins of the developing network, but was also excluded from mature arterial branch points.

Each sensory region is made up of hair cells, which are the sensory cells, and their associated supporting cells, both arising from a common progenitor. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern the development of these sensory organs. Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of hair cells and supporting cells by mediating lateral inhibition via the ligands Delta-like 1 and Jagged (JAG) 2. However, another Notch ligand, JAG1, is expressed early in the sensory patches prior to cell differentiation, indicating that there may be an earlier role for Notch signaling in sensory development in the ear. Here, using conditional gene targeting, we show that the Jag1 gene is required for the normal development of all six sensory organs within the inner ear. Cristae are completely lacking in Jag1-conditional knockout (cko) mutant inner ears, whereas the cochlea and utricle show partial sensory development. The saccular macula is present but malformed. Using SOX2 and p27kip1 as molecular markers of the prosensory domain, we show that JAG1 is initially expressed in all the prosensory regions of the ear, but becomes down-regulated in the nascent organ of Corti by embryonic day 14.5, when the cells exit the cell cycle and differentiate. We also show that both SOX2 and p27kip1 are down-regulated in Jag1-cko inner ears. Taken together, these data demonstrate that JAG1 is expressed early in the prosensory domains of both the cochlear and vestibular regions, and is required to maintain the normal expression levels of both SOX2 and p27kip1. These data demonstrate that JAG1-mediated Notch signaling is essential during early development for establishing the prosensory regions of the inner ear.", "score": 1, "id": "16410827", "title": "The

The effect of SP was evaluated by analyzing systemic inflammation, cell survival, and neovascularization within the argon laser-injured retina of mice.

De Wecker (1875, 1879) and Leber (1882) first proposed that intrinsic tears within the retina are the cause of retinal detachment, but they faced extreme and long lasting opposition for this view. Surgical results at this time were uniformly disastrous, and therapeutic nihilism still prevailed when Dufour and Gonin became convinced around 1904-1906 that the retinal tear was indeed the origin of the detachment. It took ten years, however, before Gonin figured out how to close tears by exact placement of heat coagulation (\"thermopuncture\") and provide therapeutic evidence for his beliefs. When he first presented his results in 1921, colleagues jeered at him, especially Deutschmann and Sourdille who, like the other ophthalmic surgeons, denied the role of the tear (and still made \"therapeutic\" incisions through the detached retina). Recognition of Gonin's approach finally came at the International Congresses in Amsterdam 1928 and in Madrid in 1933. Sourdille modified his approach when his son Gabriel convinced him to change after 1930, but Deutschmann stuck to his horrific procedure until his death in 1935.

His son presented a retinal hamartoma with loss of vision in his right eye at 2 months of age. At 9 years of age, asymptomatic schwannomas of the cranial nerves were discovered: cranial nerves X (left), XI (left), and VIII (bilateral).

These features must be actively sought during the first year of life in individuals at risk of NF2. NF2 mosaicism is often described as a mild form of NF2 with a very low risk of transmission to the carrier's children. We show that NF2 mosaicism can sometimes develop severe NF2 symptoms and we confirm that the transmission risk to the offspring depends on the proportion of zygotes carrying the mutation.

CHARACTERISTICS: </b>Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a multisystem disorder characterized by: tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism; a bleeding diathesis resulting from a platelet storage pool deficiency; and, in some cases, pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, or immunodeficiency. The albinism is characterized by: hypopigmentation of the skin and hair; and ocular findings of reduced iris pigment with iris transillumination, reduced retinal pigment, foveal hypoplasia with significant reduction in visual acuity (usually in the range of 20/50 to 20/400), nystagmus, and increased crossing of the optic nerve fibers. Hair color ranges from white to brown; skin color ranges from white to olive and is usually a shade lighter than that of other family members. The bleeding diathesis can result in easy bruising, frequent epistaxis, gingival bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, colonic bleeding, and prolonged bleeding with menses or after tooth extraction, circumcision, and other surgeries. Pulmonary fibrosis, a restrictive lung disease, typically causes symptoms in the early thirties and can progress to death within a decade. Granulomatous colitis is severe in about 15% of affected individuals. Neutropenia and/or immune defects are associated primarily with HPS-2.<br/><b>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: </b>The diagnosis of HPS is established by clinical findings of hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, characteristic eye findings, and demonstration of absent dense bodies on whole mount electron microscopy of platelets. Pathogenic variants in HPS1, AP3B1 (HPS2), HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, DTNBP1 (HPS7), BLOC1S3 (HPS8), and BLOC1S6 (PLDN) are known to cause HPS.<br/><b>MANAGEMENT: </b>Treatment of manifestations: Correction of refractive errors and use of low vision aids; thrombin-soaked gelfoam for skin wounds with prolonged bleeding; DDAVP (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) for wisdom tooth extraction and invasive procedures; platelet or red blood cell transfusions for surgery or protracted bleeding; supplemental oxygen and, ultimately, lung transplantation for severe pulmonary disease; steroids, other anti-inflammatory agents and/or Remicade(\u00ae) for granulomatous colitis. Immunodeficiency, when present, is granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) responsive. Prevention of secondary complications: Protection of the skin from the sun; wearing a medical alert bracelet that explicitly describes the functional platelet defect; maximizing pulmonary function before development of pulmonary fibrosis by prompt treatment of pulmonary infections, immunizing with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, and regular moderate exercise. Surveillance: Annual ophthalmologic examination; at least annual examination of the skin for solar keratoses (premalignant lesions), basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma; annual pulmonary function testing in those over age 20 years; routine history for symptoms of colitis (e.g., cramping, increased mucus in the stool, rectal bleeding). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Aspirin-containing products, cigarette smoke. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In rare families with the milder types (HPS-3, HPS-5, or HPS-6), the evaluation of apparently unaffected sibs may yield a positive diagnosis.<br/><b>GENETIC COUNSELING: </b>HPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible for those families in which the pathogenic variants have been identified.<br/>", "score": 1, "id": "20301464", "title": "Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome"}]}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "B", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "141", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "C", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00354609929078009", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "N", "Chr": "22", "freq&#46;controls": "0", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2338", "LJB_LRT": "0.818104", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "D", "Ref": "G", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "772", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000100099", "Description": "Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 4", "End": "26859917", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "HPS4", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "1", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "Func": "exonic", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.007", "dbSNP137": "rs143902143", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "0.000154", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "HPS4", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:36", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.000855", "signature": "22_26859917_G_A", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "1428.27", "Omim": "203300;606682", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "pubmed_score": 1, "Gene": "ENSG00000100099", "Obs": "A", "AAChange": "ENSG00000100099:ENST00000402105:exon9:c.C1664T:p.P555L,ENSG00000100099:ENST00000398141:exon10:c.C1718T:p.P573L,ENSG00000100099:ENST00000336873:exon11:c.C1679T:p.P560L,ENSG00000100099:ENST00000398145:exon11:c.C1679T:p.P560L", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "0", "clean&#46;signature": "22_26859917_G_A", "novel": "FALSE", "rare": "TRUE", "Start": "26859917", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "NA", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0.17", "Conserved": "410;Name=lod=62", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "3.62", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "N", "LJB_SIFT": "0.96", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.987923", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "1"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 1000, "indel&#46;length": "18", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 13, "results": [{"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>Pathophysiological events in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) are a prominent feature of several optic neuropathies including glaucoma. The purpose of this study was to identify and catalog genes whose expression in the human retina is restricted to the GCL.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Laser capture microdissection (LCM) technology was used to isolate tissue from the perimacular retina of three human donors without retinal or optic nerve disease. RNA was isolated from the (1) retinal GCL and (2) the inner and outer nuclear layers of the same retina, and the gene expression profiles of both fractions were determined using Affymetrix Hu133Plus 2.0 GeneChips. Data were analyzed to identify those genes whose expression is substantially more prevalent in the GCL when compared to the outer retinal layers. Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>The results show that mRNA levels of previously described ganglion cell markers, e.g. the neurofilament genes (NEFH, NEF3, or NEFL) and the Brn3a transcription factor (POU4F1), were highly enriched in the isolated GCL fraction. In contrast, transcripts for genes associated with phototransduction (RHO), photoreceptor development (NR2E3), or interphotoreceptor matrix constituents (IMPG1) were nearly absent from the GCL fraction. Using bioinformatics approaches over 80 genes were identified whose expression in the human retina appears to be limited to the GCL.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>We have successfully used LCM technology to generate gene expression profiles of highly enriched GCL fractions of the normal human retina.

cytoskeleton is critical for cell motility and division, both of which are important for angiogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNA/miR) are emerging as pivotal modulators of vascular development and disease. How miRNAs regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics in endothelial cells (EC) and neovascularization is still unclear. Here, we report that miR-24 regulates actin dynamics in ECs through targeting multiple members downstream of Rho signaling, including Pak4, Limk2, and Diaph1 proteins. Overexpression of miR-24 in ECs blocks stress fiber and lamellipodia formation, represses EC migration, proliferation, and tube formation in vitro, as well as angiogenesis in an ex vivo aortic ring assay. Moreover, subretinal delivery of miR-24 mimics represses laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in vivo. Mechanistically, knockdown of miR-24 target protein LIMK2 or PAK4 inhibits stress fiber formation and tube formation in vitro, mimicking miR-24 overexpression phenotype in angiogenesis, while overexpression of LIMK2 and PAK4 by adenoviruses partially rescued the tube formation defects in miR-24 overexpressing ECs. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-24 represses angiogenesis by simultaneously regulating multiple components in the actin cytoskeleton pathways.

LIMK1/LIMK2 knockouts disrupt spinal cord morphogenesis and synapse formation but other tissues and developmental processes that require LIMK are yet to be fully determined. To identify tissues and cell-types that may require LIMK, we characterised the pattern of LIMK1 protein during mouse embryogenesis.

In several tissues LIMK1 is detected in cell-types that also express Wilms' tumour protein 1 and that undergo transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states, including the pleura, epicardium, kidney nephrons, and gonads.

In order to investigate the implication of iPLA2 in these processes, this work was aimed to build an in\u00a0vivo model of iPLA2 activity inhibition. After testing the efficacy of different chemical inhibitors of iPLA2, we have validated the use of bromoenol lactone (BEL) in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo for inhibiting the activity of iPLA2. Under in\u00a0vivo conditions, a dose of 6\u03bcg/g of body weight of BEL in mice displayed a 50%-inhibition of retinal iPLA2 activity 8-16h after intraperitoneal administration. Delivering the same dose twice a day to animals was successful in producing a similar inhibition that was stable over one week.

Taken together with our previous observations that both Abeta peptides may induce hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, the present results provide evidence that this process is cooperatively mediated by cPLA(2) activation/translocation and iPLA(2) activation.

At 12 weeks of age, changes in gene expression were detected in 1,108 of 54,000 probe sets (2.05%), with most showing <2-fold change. Gene ontology analysis assigns them to diverse biological functions, notably lipid metabolism and transport, G-protein and signal transduction, development, visual perception, cytoskeleton, peptidases, stress response, transcription regulation, and 400 transcripts having no defined function. PLA2G6, a phospholipase recently associated with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, was downregulated in both LCPUFA groups. ELOVL5, a PUFA elongase, was the only LCPUFA biosynthetic enzyme that was differentially expressed. Mitochondrial fatty acid carrier, CPT2, was among several genes associated with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to be downregulated by high DHA, while the mitochondrial proton carrier, UCP2, was upregulated. TIMM8A, also known as deafness/dystonia peptide 1, was among several differentially expressed neural development genes. LUM and TIMP3, associated with corneal structure and age-related macular degeneration, respectively, were among visual perception genes influenced by LCPUFA. TIA1, a silencer of COX2 gene translation, is upregulated by high DHA. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified a highly significant nervous system network, with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as the outstanding interaction partner.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>These data indicate that LCPUFA concentrations within the normal range of human breastmilk induce global changes in gene expression across a wide array of processes, in addition to changes in visual and neural function normally associated with formula LCPUFA.<br/>", "score": 1, "id": "17426818", "title": "Differential cerebral cortex transcriptomes of baboon neonates consuming moderate and high docosahexaenoic acid formulas."}]}, "LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred": "D", "non&#46;missing&#46;cases": "141", "LJB_PhyloP_Pred": "C", "freq&#46;cases": "0.00354609929078009", "SegDup": "NA", "LJB_MutationTaster_Pred": "D", "Chr": "22", "freq&#46;controls": "0", "Samples": "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001", "non&#46;missing&#46;controls": "2451", "LJB_LRT": "1", "LJB_SIFT_Pred": "T", "Ref": "C", "core&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "remove&#46;bad&#46;transcripts": "FALSE", "non&#46;missing&#46;external&#46;controls": "817", "ensemblID": "ENSG00000184381", "Description": "phospholipase A2, group VI (cytosolic, calcium-independent)", "End": "38536029", "non&#46;syn": "TRUE", "HUGO": "PLA2G6", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;cases": "1", "dup&#46;region": "FALSE", "ensemblID&#46;bis": "NA", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "Func": "exonic", "LJB_PolyPhen2": "0.98", "dbSNP137": "", "ExonicFunc": "nonsynonymous SNV", "ESP6500si_ALL": "NA", "HUGO&#46;no&#46;splice&#46;info": "PLA2G6", "IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001": "0|1:100", "LJB_MutationTaster": "0.999962", "signature": "22_38536029_C_T", "somewhat&#46;rare": "TRUE", "is&#46;indel": "FALSE", "QUAL": "1770.51", "Omim": "603604", "potential&#46;comp&#46;het": "FALSE", "freq&#46;external&#46;controls": "0", "pubmed_score": 21, "Gene": "ENSG00000184381", "Obs": "T", "AAChange": "ENSG00000184381:ENST00000498338:exon2:c.G223A:p.G75S,ENSG00000184381:ENST00000332509:exon5:c.G757A:p.G253S,ENSG00000184381:ENST00000335539:exon5:c.G757A:p.G253S,ENSG00000184381:ENST00000402064:exon5:c.G757A:p.G253S", "lof": "FALSE", "exonic&#46;splicing": "FALSE", "non&#46;ref&#46;calls&#46;controls": "0", "clean&#46;signature": "22_38536029_C_T", "novel": "TRUE", "rare": "TRUE", "Start": "38536029", "cg69": "NA", "X1000g2012apr_ALL": "NA", "missing&#46;rate&#46;cases": "0", "FILTER": "PASS", "AVSIFT": "0", "Conserved": "480;Name=lod=119", "LJB_GERP&#46;&#46;": "5.22", "LJB_LRT_Pred": "D", "LJB_SIFT": "0.95", "LJB_PhyloP": "0.998839", "ncarriers&#46;cases": "1"}, {"splicing": "FALSE", "pred_score": 7, "indel&#46;length": "0", "ref(pubmedID)": {"known": 0, "total_score": 8, "results": [{"abstract": "<b>PURPOSE: </b>To develop methods for primary culture of human blood-retinal barrier (BRB) cells and to explore the expression of APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3) family gene, novel host-defense factors to HIV-1.<br/><b>METHODS: </b>Cellular components of human BRB (human retinal capillary endothelial cells [HRCECs], human retinal capillary pericytes, and human retinal pigment epithelial cells) were isolated separately and subjected to primary culture according to procedures modified in our laboratory. Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to identify specific markers of the primary cells and to analyze their purity by flow cytometry. RNA of the three different cells was isolated, and primers were designed to probe expression of the APOBEC3 gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. For further confirmation, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G proteins were detected in the cultured cells and fresh retina tissue through Western blot analysis. In the end, HRCECs were treated with IFN-gamma, and change of APOBEC3G expression was displayed.<br/><b>RESULTS: </b>Pure BRB cells (>95% purity) were primary cultured according to procedures modified in our laboratory. Qualitative test of RT-PCR and semiquantitative examination of real-time PCR demonstrated the presence of APOBEC3B, -3C, -3F, and -3G genes and the absence of APOBEC3A and -3D genes in all cellular components of the BRB. Finding of the APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F proteins expressed in the three primary cultured cells and different layers of retinal tissue by Western blot analysis further confirmed the PCR results. Moreover, IFN-gamma could upregulate the expression of APOBEC3G in HRCECs.<br/><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Major cellular components of human BRB could be primary cultured in vitro according to procedures optimized in our laboratory. Different expression of APOBEC3 in human blood-retinal barrier gives a clue to further research in intrinsic antiviral immunity in HIV-1-related retinopathy.<br/>", "score": 8, "id": "19369234",

ultrastructural changes of the glomerular basement membrane (thinning, thickening, and splitting), sensorineural deafness, and variable ocular abnormalities (anterior lenticonus, macular flecks, and cataracts). The most common mode of transmission is X-linked inheritance, due to COL4A5 mutations. X-linked ATS is rarely associated with diffuse leiomyomatosis (DL), a benign hypertrophy of the visceral smooth muscle in gastrointestinal, respiratory, and female reproductive tracts. The ATS-DL complex is due to deletions that encompass the 5' ends of the COL4A5 and COL4A6 genes and include the bidirectional promoter. In this paper, we described 3 ATS-DL cases, 2 familial and 1 sporadic bearing a deletion encompassing the 5'-end of both the COL4A5 and COL4A6 genes, as identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis. The array-CGH technique allowed a better definition of deletion size, confirming that the proximal breakpoint was within COL4A6 intron 2 in 2 cases. Surprisingly, 1 case had a deletion extending proximally beyond exon 3 of COL4A6, as confirmed by qPCR analysis. This is the largest deletion reported to date that has been associated with ATS-DL and this case should lead us to reconsider the mechanisms that might be involved in the development of diffuse leiomyomatosis.", "score": 1, "id": "21380622", "title": "Alport syndrome and leiomyomatosis: the first deletion extending beyond COL4A6 intron 2."}, {"abstract": "Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary nephropathy with hematuria progressing to end-stage renal failure (ESRF), sensorineural deafness, and specific eye signs (lenticonus, macular flecks, and congenital cataracts). Inheritance is X-linked in about 85% of the cases, caused by different mutations in the COL4A5 gene. Rarely AS is seen in combination with diffuse leiomyomatosis (DL). DL is a tumorous process involving smooth muscle cells, mostly of the esophagus, but also of the tracheobronchial tree and the female genital tract. Characteristically, the patients have deletions of the 5'-end of both the COL4A5 and the COL4A6 genes, respectively. We here present a 9-year-old boy who was admitted because of a newly diagnosed sensorineural deafness. He was born with cataracts and presented symptoms of dysphagia and bronchial irritation in the first year of life. Macroscopic hematuria was first noticed at 2 years during a febrile infection. Since early childhood the boy suffered from severe constipation. Taking together these symptoms, the diagnosis of Alport syndrome with diffuse leiomyomatosis (AS-DL) has to be considered.
